I hereby declare that I have written the submitted Master's thesis without outside help. I have marked as such all statements taken verbatim or in spirit from other works, if applicable also from electronic media. I am aware that my Master's thesis in digital form will be checked for plagiarism if unmarked texts are used in whole or in part. A violation of the basic rules of scientific work is considered as an attempt to deceive or cheat and will result in the corresponding consequences according to the valid examination regulations of the Medical Radiation Sciences degree programme. For the purpose of comparing my Master's thesis with existing sources, I agree that my Master's thesis will be entered into a database where it will remain after my graduation. I do not cede any further rights to reprint and use it. I further declare that the thesis has not been the subject of any other examination procedure, neither in its entirety nor in essential parts, and that it has not been published.
