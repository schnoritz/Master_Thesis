	abstract = {Purpose: The graphical processing unit ͑{GPU}͒ on modern graphics cards offers the possibility of accelerating arithmetically intensive tasks. By splitting the work into a large number of independent jobs, order-of-magnitude speedups are reported. In this article, the possible speedup of {PLATO}’s ray tracing algorithm for dose calculations using a {GPU} is investigated.
Methods: A {GPU} version of the ray tracing algorithm was implemented using {NVIDIA}’s {CUDA}, which extends the standard C language with functionality to program graphics cards. The developed algorithm was compared based on the accuracy and speed to a multithreaded version of the {PLATO} ray tracing algorithm. This comparison was performed for three test geometries, a phantom and two radiotherapy planning {CT} datasets ͑a pelvic and a head-and-neck case͒. For each geometry, four different source positions were evaluated. In addition to this, for the head-and-neck case also a vertex ﬁeld was evaluated.
Results: The {GPU} algorithm was proven to be more accurate than the {PLATO} algorithm by elimination of the look-up table for z indices that introduces discretization errors in the reference algorithm. Speedups for ray tracing were found to be in the range of 2.1–10.1, relative to the multithreaded {PLATO} algorithm running four threads. For dose calculations the speedup measured was in the range of 1.5–6.2. For the speedup of both the ray tracing and the dose calculation, a strong dependency on the tested geometry was found. This dependency is related to the fraction of air within the patient’s bounding box resulting in idle threads.
Conclusions: With the use of a {GPU}, ray tracing for dose calculations can be performed accurately in considerably less time. Ray tracing was accelerated, on average, with a factor of 6 for the evaluated cases. Dose calculation for a single beam can typically be carried out in 0.6– 0.9 s for clinically realistic datasets. These ﬁndings can be used in conventional planning to enable ͑nearly͒ real-time dose calculations. Also the importance for treatment optimization techniques is evident. © 2009 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. ͓{DOI}: 10.1118/1.3190156͔},

	abstract = {{IMRT} optimization requires a fast yet relatively accurate algorithm to calculate the iteration dose with small memory demand. In this paper, we present a dose calculation algorithm that approaches these goals. By decomposing the inﬁnitesimal pencil beam ({IPB}) kernel into the central axis ({CAX}) component and lateral spread function ({LSF}) and taking the beam’s eye view ({BEV}), we established a non-voxel and non-beamlet-based dose calculation formula. Both {LSF} and {CAX} are determined by a commissioning procedure using the collapsed-cone convolution/superposition ({CCCS}) method as the standard dose engine. The proposed dose calculation involves a 2D convolution of a ﬂuence map with {LSF} followed by ray tracing based on the {CAX} lookup table with radiological distance and divergence correction, resulting in complexity of O(N3) both spatially and temporally. This simple algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the {CCCS} method. Without pre-calculation of beamlets, its implementation is also orders of magnitude smaller than the conventional voxel-based beamlet-superposition ({VBS}) approach. We compared the presented algorithm with the {CCCS} method using simulated and clinical cases. The agreement was generally within 3\% for a homogeneous phantom and 5\% for heterogeneous and clinical cases. Combined with the ‘adaptive full dose correction’, the algorithm is well suitable for calculating the iteration dose during {IMRT} optimization.},

	title = {Long short-term memory networks for proton dose calculation in highly heterogeneous tissues},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06085},
	abstract = {A novel dose calculation approach was designed based on the application of {LSTM} network that processes the 3D patient/phantom geometry as a sequence of 2D computed tomography input slices yielding a corresponding sequence of 2D slices that forms the respective 3D dose distribution. {LSTM} networks can propagate information effectively in one direction, resulting in a model that can properly imitate the mechanisms of proton interaction in matter. The study is centered on predicting dose on a single pencil beam level, avoiding the averaging effects in treatment plans comprised of thousands pencil beams. Moreover, such approach allows straightforward integration into today’s treatment planning systems’ inverse planning optimization process. The ground truth training data was prepared with Monte Carlo simulations for both phantom and patient studies by simulating different pencil beams impinging from random gantry angles through the patient geometry. For model training, 10’000 Monte Carlo simulations were prepared for the phantom study, and 4’000 simulations were prepared for the patient study. The trained {LSTM} model was able to achieve a 99.29 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 1 mm]) accuracy on the set-aside test set for the phantom study, and a 99.33 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 2 mm]) for the set-aside test set for the patient study. These results were achieved for each pencil beam in 6-23 ms. The average Monte Carlo simulation run-time using Topas was 1160 s. The generalization of the model was veriﬁed by testing for 5 previously unseen lung cancer patients. {LSTM} networks are well suited for proton therapy dose calculation tasks. However, further work needs to be performed to generalize the proposed approach to clinical applications, primarily to be implemented for various energies, patient sites, and {CT} resolutions/scanners.},

Accounting for these demands high speed, online intensity-modulated radiotherapy ({IMRT}) reoptimization. In this paper, a fast {IMRT} optimization system is described which combines a {GPU}-based Monte Carlo dose calculation engine for online beamlet generation and a fast inverse dose optimization algorithm. Tightly conformal {IMRT} plans are generated for four phantom cases and two clinical cases (cervix and kidney) in the presence of the magnetic ﬁelds of 0 and 1.5 T. We show that for the presented cases the beamlet generation and optimization routines are fast enough for online {IMRT} planning. Furthermore, there is no inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on plan quality and complexity, and equal optimization constraints at 0 and 1.5 T lead to almost identical dose distributions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Deep Learning ({DL}) is a machine learning technique that uses deep neural networks to create a model. The application areas of deep learning in radiation oncology include image segmentation and detection, image phenotyping, and radiomic signature discovery, clinical outcome prediction, image dose quantiﬁcation, dose-response modeling, radiation adaptation, and image generation. In this review, we explain the methods used in {DL} and perform a literature review using the Medline database to identify studies using deep learning in radiation oncology. The search was conducted in April 2018, and identiﬁed studies published between 1997 and 2018, strongly skewed toward 2015 and later.
Methods: A literature review was performed using {PubMed}/Medline in order to identify important recent publications to be synthesized into a review of the current status of Deep Learning in radiation oncology, directed at a clinically-oriented reader. The search strategy included the search terms “radiotherapy” and “deep learning.” In addition, reference lists of selected articles were hand searched for further potential hits of relevance to this review. The search was conducted in April 2018, and identiﬁed studies published between 1997 and 2018, strongly skewed toward 2015 and later.
Results: Studies using {DL} for image segmentation were identiﬁed in Brain (n = 2), Head and Neck (n = 3), Lung (n = 6), Abdominal (n = 2), and Pelvic (n = 6) cancers. Use of Deep Learning has also been reported for outcome prediction, such as toxicity modeling (n = 3), treatment response and survival (n = 2), or treatment planning (n = 5).
Conclusion: Over the past few years, there has been a signiﬁcant number of studies assessing the performance of {DL} techniques in radiation oncology. They demonstrate how {DL}-based systems can aid clinicians in their daily work, be it by reducing the time required for or the variability in segmentation, or by helping to predict treatment outcomes and toxicities. It still remains to be seen when these techniques will be employed in routine clinical practice.},

This information is acquired by time consuming ray-tracingbased calculations. For treatment planning scenarios with changing geometries and real-time constraints this is a severe bottleneck. We implemented an algorithm for the graphics processing unit ({GPU}) which implements a ray-matrix approach to reduce the number of rays to trace. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of diﬀerent strategies of accessing memory in kernel implementations as well as strategies for rapid data transfers between main memory and memory of the graphics device. Our study included the overlapping of computations and memory transfers to reduce the overall runtime using Hyper-Q. We tested our approach on a prostate case (9 beams, coplanar). The measured execution times for a complete ray-tracing range from 28 msec for the computations on the {GPU} to 99 msec when considering data transfers to and from the graphics device. Our {GPU}-based algorithm performed the ray-tracing in real-time. The strategies eﬃciently reduce the time consumption of memory accesses and data transfer overhead. The achieved runtimes demonstrate the viability of this approach and allow improved real-time performance for dose calculation methods in clinical routine.},

It is capable of Adaptive Radiotherapy and consists of a {GPU} Monte Carlo dose engine, an inverse dose optimization algorithm and a novel adaptive sequencing algorithm. The system is able to compensate for patient anatomy changes and enables radiation delivery immediately from the first calculated segment. {IMRT} plans meeting all clinical constraints were generated for two breast cases, one spinal bone metastasis case, two prostate cases with integrated boost regions and one head and neck case. These plans were generated by the segment weighted version of our algorithm, in a 0 T environment in order to test the feasibility of the new sequencing strategy in current clinical conditions, yielding very small differences between the fluence and sequenced distributions. All plans went through stringent experimental quality assurance on Delta4 and passed all clinical tests currently performed in our institute. A new inter-fraction adaptation scheme built on top of this algorithm is also proposed that enables convergence to the ideal dose distribution without the need of a final segment weight optimization. The first results of this method confirm that convergence is achieved within the first fractions of the treatment. These features combined will lead to a fully adaptive intra-fraction planning system able to take into account patient anatomy updates during treatment.},

The ability of the system to take into account organ motion and adapt the plan to the latest anatomy state is illustrated using artificial baseline shifts created for three different kidney cases. Firstly, for two kidney cases of different target volumes, we show that the system can account for intrafraction motion, delivering the intended dose to the target with minimal dose deposition to the surroundings compared to conventional plans. Secondly, for a third kidney case we show that our algorithm combined with the interfraction scheme can be used to deliver the prescribed dose while adapting to the changing anatomy during multi-fraction treatments without performing a final {SWO}.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop an automated treatment planning strategy for external beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}), including a deep learning-based three-dimensional (3D) dose prediction and a dose distribution-based plan generation algorithm.
Methods and Materials: A residual neural network-based deep learning model is trained to predict a dose distribution based on patient-specific geometry and prescription dose. A total of 270 headand-neck cancer cases were enrolled in this study, including 195 cases in the training dataset, 25 cases in the validation dataset, and 50 cases in the testing dataset. All patients were treated with {IMRT} with a variety of different prescription patterns. The model input consists of {CT} images and contours delineating the organs at risk ({OARs}) and planning target volumes ({PTVs}). The algorithm output is trained to predict the dose distribution on the {CT} image slices. The obtained prediction model is used to predict dose distributions for new patients. Then, an optimization objective function based on these predicted dose distributions is created for automatic plan generation.
Results: Our results demonstrate that the deep learning method can predict clinically acceptable dose distributions. There is no statistically significant difference between prediction and real clinical plan for all clinically relevant dose–volume histogram ({DVH}) indices, except brainstem, right and left lens. However, the predicted plans were still clinically acceptable. The results of plan generation show no statistically significant differences between the automatic generated plan and the predicted plan except {PTV}70.4, but the difference is only 0.5\% which is still clinically acceptable.
Conclusion: This study developed a new automated radiotherapy treatment planning system based on 3D dose prediction and 3D dose distribution-based optimization. It is a promising approach for realizing automated treatment planning in the future. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13271]},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for prediction of three-dimensional (3D) voxel-byvoxel dose distributions of helical tomotherapy ({HT}).
Methods: Using previously treated {HT} plans as training data, a deep learning model named U-{ResNet}-D was trained to predict a 3D dose distribution. First, the contoured structures and dose volumes were converted from plan database to 3D matrix with a program based on a developed visualization toolkit ({VTK}), then transferred to U-{ResNet}-D for correlating anatomical features and dose distributions at voxel-level. One hundred and ninety nasopharyngeal cancer ({NPC}) patients treated by {HT} with multiple planning target volumes ({PTVs}) in different prescription patterns were studied. The model was typically trained from scratch with weights randomly initialized rather than using transferlearning method, and used to predict new patient’s 3D dose distributions. The predictive accuracy was evaluated with three methods: (a) The dose difference at the position r, d(r, r) = Dc(r) À Dp(r), was calculated for each voxel. The mean (ld(r,r)) and standard deviation (rd(r,r)) of d(r, r) were calculated to assess the prediction bias and precision; (b) The mean absolute differences of dosimetric indexes ({DIs}) including maximum and mean dose, homogeneity index, conformity index, and dose spillage for {PTVs} and organ at risks ({OARs}) were calculated and statistically analyzed with the paired-samples t test; (c) Dice similarity coefficients ({DSC}) between predicted and clinical isodose volumes were calculated.
Results: The U-{ResNet}-D model predicted 3D dose distribution accurately. For twenty tested patients, the prediction bias ranged from À2.0\% to 2.3\% and prediction error varied from 1.5\% to 4.5\% (relative to prescription) for 3D dose differences. The mean absolute dose differences for {PTVs} and {OARs} are within 2.0\% and 4.2\%, and nearly all the {DIs} for {PTVs} and {OARs} had no significant differences. The averaged {DSC} ranged from 0.95 to 1 for different isodose volumes.
Conclusions: The study developed a new deep learning method for 3D voxel-by-voxel dose prediction, and shown to be able to produce accurately dose predictions for nasopharyngeal patients treated by {HT}. The predicted 3D dose map can be useful for improving radiotherapy planning design, ensuring plan quality and consistency, making clinical technique comparison, and guiding automatic treatment planning. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/ mp.13490]},

	abstract = {Purpose/objective(s): Online proton range/dose verification based on measurements of proton-induced positron emitters is a promising strategy for quality assurance in proton therapy. Because of the nonlinear correlation between the dose distribution and the activity distribution of positron emitters in addition to the presence of noise, machine learning approaches were proposed to establish their relationship. Materials/methods: Simulations were carried out with a spot-scanning proton system using {GATE}8.0 and Geant4-10.3 toolkit with a computed tomography ({CT})-based patient phantom. The one-dimensional (1D) distributions of positron emitters and radiation dose were obtained. A feedforward neural network classification model comprising two hidden layers, was developed to estimate whether the range is within a preset threshold. A recurrent neural network ({RNN}) regression model comprising three layers and ten neurons in each hidden layer was developed to estimate dose distribution. The performance was quantitatively studied in terms of mean squared error ({MSE}) and mean absolute error ({MAE}) under different signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) values.
Results: The feasibility of proton range and dose verification using the proposed neural network framework was demonstrated. The feedforward {NN} model achieves high classification accuracy close to 100\% for individual classes without bias. The {RNN} model is able to accurately predict the 1D dose distribution for different energies and irradiation positions. When the {SNR} of the input activity profiles is above 4, the framework is able to predict with an {MAE} of {\textasciitilde}0.60 mm and an {MSE} of {\textasciitilde}0.066. Moreover, the model demonstrates a good capability of generalization.
Conclusions: The {RNN} model is found to be effective in identifying the relationship between the distributions of dose and positron emitters. The machine learning-based framework and {RNN} models may be a useful tool to allow for accurate online range and dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13827]},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop, implement, and validate a full 1.5 T/7 {MV} magnetic resonance ({MR})-Linac accelerator head and cryostat model in {EGSnrc} for high precision dose calculations accounting for magnetic field effects that are independent from the vendor treatment planning system.
Methods: Primary electron beam parameters for the implemented model were adapted to be in accordance with measured dose profiles of the Elekta Unity (Elekta {AB}, Stockholm, Sweden). Parameters to be investigated were the mean electron energy as well as the Gaussian radial intensity and energy distributions. Energy tuning was done comparing depth dose profiles simulated with monoenergetic beams of varying energies to measurements. The optimum radial intensity distribution was found by varying the radial full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) and comparing simulated and measured lateral profiles. The influence of the energy distribution was investigated by comparing simulated lateral and depth dose profiles with varying energy spreads to measured data. Comparison of simulations and measurements was performed by calculating average and maximum local dose deviations. The model was validated recalculating a clinical intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan for the {MR}-Linac and comparing the resulting dose distribution with simulations from the commercial treatment planning system Monaco using the gamma criterion.
Results: Comparison of simulated and measured data showed that the optimum initial electron beam for {MR}-Linac simulations was monoenergetic with an electron energy of (7.4 Æ 0.2) {MeV}. The optimum Gaussian radial intensity distribution has a {FWHM} of (2.2 Æ 0.3) mm. The average relative deviations were smaller than 1\% for all simulated profiles with optimum electron parameters, whereas the largest maximum deviation of 2.07\% was found for the 22 9 22 cm2 cross-plane profile. Profiles were insensitive to energy spread variations. The {IMRT} plan recalculated with the final {MR}-Linac model with optimized initial electron beam parameters showed a gamma pass rate of 99.83 \% using a gamma criterion of 3\%/3 mm.
Conclusions: The {EGSnrc} {MR}-Linac model developed in this study showed good accordance with measurements and was successfully used to recalculate a first full clinical {IMRT} treatment plan. Thus, it shows the general possibility for future secondary dose calculations of full {IMRT} plans with {EGSnrc}, which needs further detailed investigations before clinical use. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Various dose calculation algorithms are available for radiation therapy for cancer patients. However, these algorithms are faced with the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally less accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In this work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning ({DL}) for dose calculation.
Methods: We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation engine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net ({HD} U-net) model and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) cases. Mapping from an {IMRT} fluence map domain to a three-dimensional (3D) dose domain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge training dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to the dose domain using a broad beam ray-tracing ({RT}) algorithm, and then we use the {HD} U-net to map the {RT} dose distribution into an accurate dose distribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/ superposition ({CS}) algorithm. The model is trained on 70 patients with fivefold cross validation, and tested on a separate 8 patients.
Results: It takes about 1 s to compute a 3D dose distribution for a typical 7-field prostate {IMRT} plan, which can be further reduced to achieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. The average Gamma passing rate between {DL} and {CS} dose distributions for the 8 test patients are 98.5\% (Æ1.6\%) at 1 mm/1\% and 99.9\% (Æ0.1\%) at 2 mm/2\%. For comparison of various clinical evaluation criteria (dose-volume points) for {IMRT} plans between two dose distributions, the average difference for dose criteria is less than 0.25 Gy while for volume criteria is {\textless}0.16\%, showing that the {DL} dose distributions are clinically identical to the {CS} dose distributions.
Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of using {DL} for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high accuracy and efficiency. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13953]},

	abstract = {Purpose: Many researchers have developed deep learning models for predicting clinical dose distributions and Pareto optimal dose distributions. Models for predicting Pareto optimal dose distributions have generated optimal plans in real time using anatomical structures and static beam orientations. However, Pareto optimal dose prediction for intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) prostate planning with variable beam numbers and orientations has not yet been investigated. We propose to develop a deep learning model that can predict Pareto optimal dose distributions by using any given set of beam angles, along with patient anatomy, as input to train the deep neural networks. We implement and compare two deep learning networks that predict with two different beam configuration modalities.
Methods: We generated Pareto optimal plans for 70 patients with prostate cancer. We used fluence map optimization to generate 500 {IMRT} plans that sampled the Pareto surface for each patient, for a total of 35 000 plans. We studied and compared two different models, Models I and {II}. Although they both used the same anatomical structures — including the planning target volume ({PTV}), organs at risk ({OARs}), and body — these models were designed with two different methods for representing beam angles. Model I directly uses beam angles as a second input to the network as a binary vector. Model {II} converts the beam angles into beam doses that are conformal to the {PTV}. We divided the 70 patients into 54 training, 6 validation, and 10 testing patients, thus yielding 27 000 training, 3000 validation, and 5000 testing plans. Mean square loss ({MSE}) was taken as the loss function. We used the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.01 to optimize the network’s performance. We evaluated the models’ performance by comparing their predicted dose distributions with the ground truth (Pareto optimal) dose distribution, in terms of dose volume histogram ({DVH}) plots and evaluation metrics such as {PTV} D98, D95, D50, D2, Dmax, Dmean, Paddick Conformation Number, R50, and Homogeneity index.
Results: Our deep learning models predicted voxel-level dose distributions that precisely matched the ground truth dose distributions. The {DVHs} generated also precisely matched the ground truth. Evaluation metrics such as {PTV} statistics, dose conformity, dose spillage (R50), and homogeneity index also confirmed the accuracy of {PTV} curves on the {DVH}. Quantitatively, Model I’s prediction error of 0.043 (confirmation), 0.043 (homogeneity), 0.327 (R50), 2.80\% (D95), 3.90\% (D98), 0.6\% (D50), and 1.10\% (D2) was lower than that of Model {II}, which obtained 0.076 (confirmation), 0.058 (homogeneity), 0.626 (R50), 7.10\% (D95), 6.50\% (D98), 8.40\% (D50), and 6.30\% (D2). Model I also outperformed Model {II} in terms of the mean dose error and the max dose error on the {PTV}, bladder, rectum, left femoral head, and right femoral head.
Conclusions: Treatment planners who use our models will be able to use deep learning to control the trade-offs between the {PTV} and {OAR} weights, as well as the beam number and configurations in real time. Our dose prediction methods provide a stepping stone to building automatic {IMRT} treatment planning. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/ mp.14374]},

	abstract = {A novel dose calculation approach was designed based on the application of {LSTM} network that processes the 3D patient/phantom geometry as a sequence of 2D computed tomography input slices yielding a corresponding sequence of 2D slices that forms the respective 3D dose distribution. {LSTM} networks can propagate information effectively in one direction, resulting in a model that can properly imitate the mechanisms of proton interaction in matter. The study is centered on predicting dose on a single pencil beam level, avoiding the averaging effects in treatment plans comprised of thousands pencil beams. Moreover, such approach allows straightforward integration into today’s treatment planning systems’ inverse planning optimization process. The ground truth training data was prepared with Monte Carlo simulations for both phantom and patient studies by simulating different pencil beams impinging from random gantry angles through the patient geometry. For model training, 10’000 Monte Carlo simulations were prepared for the phantom study, and 4’000 simulations were prepared for the patient study. The trained {LSTM} model was able to achieve a 99.29 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 1 mm]) accuracy on the set-aside test set for the phantom study, and a 99.33 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 2 mm]) for the set-aside test set for the patient study. These results were achieved for each pencil beam in 6-23 ms. The average Monte Carlo simulation run-time using Topas was 1160 s. The generalization of the model was veriﬁed by testing for 5 previously unseen lung cancer patients. {LSTM} networks are well suited for proton therapy dose calculation tasks. However, further work needs to be performed to generalize the proposed approach to clinical applications, primarily to be implemented for various energies, patient sites, and {CT} resolutions/scanners.},

This information is acquired by time consuming ray-tracingbased calculations. For treatment planning scenarios with changing geometries and real-time constraints this is a severe bottleneck. We implemented an algorithm for the graphics processing unit ({GPU}) which implements a ray-matrix approach to reduce the number of rays to trace. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of diﬀerent strategies of accessing memory in kernel implementations as well as strategies for rapid data transfers between main memory and memory of the graphics device. Our study included the overlapping of computations and memory transfers to reduce the overall runtime using Hyper-Q. We tested our approach on a prostate case (9 beams, coplanar). The measured execution times for a complete ray-tracing range from 28 msec for the computations on the {GPU} to 99 msec when considering data transfers to and from the graphics device. Our {GPU}-based algorithm performed the ray-tracing in real-time. The strategies eﬃciently reduce the time consumption of memory accesses and data transfer overhead. The achieved runtimes demonstrate the viability of this approach and allow improved real-time performance for dose calculation methods in clinical routine.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the development of the integration of a {MRI}-scanner with a linear accelerator, the inﬂuence of a lateral, magnetic ﬁeld on the dose distribution has to be determined. Dose increase is expected at tissue-air boundaries, due to the electron return effect ({ERE}): electrons entering air will describe a circular path and return into the phantom causing extra dose deposition. Using {IMRT} with many beam directions, this exit dose will not constitute a problem. Dose levels behind air cavities will decrease because of the absence of electrons crossing the cavity. The {ERE} has been demonstrated both by simulation and experiment. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with {GEANT}4, irradiating a water–air–water phantom in a lateral magnetic ﬁeld. Also an air tube in water has been simulated, resulting in slightly twisted regions of dose increase and decrease. Experimental demonstration is achieved by ﬁlm measurement in a perspex–air–perspex phantom in an electromagnet. Although the {ERE} causes dose increase before air cavities, relatively ﬂat dose proﬁles can be obtained for the investigated cases using opposite beam conﬁgurations. More research will be necessary whether this holds for more realistic geometries with the use of {IMRT} and whether the {ERE} can be turned to our advantage when treating small tumour sites at air cavities.},

	abstract = {At the {UMC} Utrecht, in collaboration with Elekta and Philips Research Hamburg, we are developing a radiotherapy accelerator with integrated {MRI} functionality. The radiation dose will be delivered in the presence of a lateral 1.5 T ﬁeld. Although the photon beam is not affected by the magnetic ﬁeld, the actual dose deposition is done by a cascade of secondary electrons and these electrons are affected by the Lorentz force. The magnetic ﬁeld causes a reduced build-up distance: because the trajectory of the electrons between collisions is curved, the entrance depth in tissue decreases. Also, at tissue–air interfaces an increased dose occurs due to the so-called electron return effect ({ERE}): electrons leaving tissue will describe a circular path in air and re-enter the tissue yielding a local dose increase. In this paper the impact of a 1.5 T magnetic ﬁeld on both the build-up distance and the dose increase due to the {ERE} will be investigated as a function of the angle between the surface and the incident beam. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that in the presence of a 1.5 T magnetic ﬁeld, the surface dose, the build-up distance and the exit dose depend more heavily on the surface orientation than in the case without magnetic ﬁeld. This is caused by the asymmetrical pointspread kernel in the presence of 1.5 T and the directional behaviour of the re-entering electrons. Simulations on geometrical phantoms show that {ERE} dose increase at air cavities can be avoided using opposing beams, also when the air–tissue boundary is not perpendicular to the beam. For the more general case in patient anatomies, more problems may arise. Future work will address the possibilities and limitations of opposing beams in combination with {IMRT} in a magnetic ﬁeld.},

We start by briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks, including the vision tasks they enable, in the context of healthcare. Next, we discuss several example medical imaging applications that stand to benefit—including cardiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology–and propose new avenues for continued work. We then expand into general medical video, highlighting ways in which clinical workflows can integrate computer vision to enhance care.

	abstract = {Background and purpose: The promise of the {MR}-linac is that one can visualize all anatomical changes during the course of radiotherapy and hence adapt the treatment plan in order to always have the optimal treatment. Yet, there is a trade-off to be made between the time spent for adapting the treatment plan against the dosimetric gain. In this work, the various daily plan adaptation methods will be presented and applied on a variety of tumour sites. The aim is to provide an insight in the behavior of the state-of-the-art 1.5 T {MRI} guided on-line adaptive radiotherapy methods. Materials and methods: To explore the different available plan adaptation workﬂows and methods, we have simulated online plan adaptation for ﬁve cases with varying levels of inter-fraction motion, regions of interest and target sizes: prostate, rectum, esophagus and lymph node oligometastases (single and multiple target). The plans were evaluated based on the clinical dose constraints and the optimization time was measured.
Results: The time needed for plan adaptation ranged between 17 and 485 s. More advanced plan adaptation methods generally resulted in more plans that met the clinical dose criteria. Violations were often caused by insufﬁcient {PTV} coverage or, for the multiple lymph node case, a too high dose to {OAR} in the vicinity of the {PTV}. With full online replanning it was possible to create plans that met all clinical dose constraints for all cases.
Conclusion: Daily full online replanning is the most robust adaptive planning method for Unity. It is feasible for speciﬁc sites in clinically acceptable times. Faster methods are available, but before applying these, the speciﬁc use cases should be explored dosimetrically.},

The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

	abstract = {Emerging magnetic resonance ({MR}) guided radiotherapy affords significantly improved anatomy visualization and, subsequently, more effective personalized treatment. The new therapy paradigm imposes significant demands on radiation dose calculation quality and speed, creating an unmet need for the acceleration of Monte Carlo ({MC}) dose calculation. Existing deep learning approaches to denoise the final plan {MC} dose fail to achieve the accuracy and speed requirements of large-scale beamlet dose calculation in the presence of a strong magnetic field for online adaptive radiotherapy planning. Our deep learning dose calculation method, {DeepMC}, addresses these needs by predicting low-noise dose from extremely noisy (but fast) {MC}-simulated dose and anatomical inputs, thus enabling significant acceleration. {DeepMC} simultaneously reduces {MC} sampling noise and predicts corrupted dose buildup at tissue-air material interfaces resulting from {MR}-field induced electron return effects. Here we demonstrate our model’s ability to accelerate dose calculation for daily treatment planning by a factor of 38 over traditional low-noise {MC} simulation with clinically meaningful accuracy in deliverable dose and treatment delivery parameters. As a post-processing approach, {DeepMC} provides compounded acceleration of large-scale dose calculation when used alongside established {MC} acceleration techniques in variance reduction and graphics processing unit-based {MC} simulation.},

	abstract = {Background
Currently there is an ever increasing interest in Lu-177 targeted radionuclide therapies, which target neuro-endocrine and prostate tumours. For a patient-specific treatment, an individual dosimetry based on {SPECT}/{CT} imaging is necessary. The aim of this study is to introduce a dosimetry method, where dose voxel kernels ({DVK}) are predicted by a neural network.
Methods
Kidneys are considered one of the most critical organs in any radionuclide therapy. Hence we chose kidneys of 26 patients, who underwent Lu-177-{DOTATOC} or {PSMA} therapy, as target organs for our dosimetric method. First of all, density kernels with a size of 9×9×9 voxels were considered, and the corresponding {DVKs} were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. These kernels were used to train a neural network ({NN}), which received a density kernel as input and predicted a {DVK} at the output. To predict the dose distribution of an entire kidney, the organ had to be partitioned into a large number of density kernels. Afterwards the {DVKs} were predicted by a trained {NN}, and employed to reconstruct the whole-organ dose distribution by convolution with the activity distribution. This method was compared to the standard method where the activity distribution is convolved with a {DVK} based on a homogeneous soft tissue kernel.
Results
The number of training kernels amounted to 52,274 density kernels with corresponding {MC}-derived {DVKs}. The results serve as proof of principle of the newly proposed method and showed that the {NN} approach yielded superior results compared to the standard method with no additional computational effort.
Conclusion
The {NN} approach is an accurate and highly competitive dosimetric method to precisely estimate absorbed radiation dose in critical organs like kidneys in clinical routine. To further improve the results, a larger number of {DVKs} needs to be computed by Monte Carlo simulations. An extension of the method to other organs is easily conceivable.},

	abstract = {There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

	abstract = {The next great leap toward improving treatment of cancer with radiation will require the combined use of online adaptive and magnetic resonance guided radiation therapy techniques with automatic X-ray beam orientation selection. Unfortunately, by uniting these advancements, we are met with a substantial expansion in the required dose information and consequential increase to the overall computational time imposed during radiation treatment planning, which cannot be handled by existing techniques for accelerating Monte Carlo dose calculation. We propose a deep convolutional neural network approach that unlocks new levels of acceleration and accuracy with regards to post-processed Monte Carlo dose results by relying on data-driven learned representations of low-level beamlet dose distributions instead of more limited filter-based denoising techniques that only utilize the information in a single dose input. Our method uses parallel {UNET} branches acting on three input channels before mixing latent understanding to produce noise-free dose predictions. Our model achieves a normalized mean absolute error of only 0.106\% compared with the ground truth dose contrasting the 25.7\% error of the under sampled {MC} dose fed into the network at prediction time. Our model's per-beamlet prediction time is {\textasciitilde}220ms, including Monte Carlo simulation and network prediction, with substantial additional acceleration expected from batched processing and combination with existing Monte Carlo acceleration techniques. Our method shows promise toward enabling clinical practice of advanced treatment technologies.},

	abstract = {Objective
Dose prediction using deep learning networks prior to radiotherapy might lead tomore efficient modality selections. The study goal was to predict proton and photon dose distributions based on the patient-specific anatomy and to assess their clinical usage for paediatric abdominal tumours.
Material and methods
Data from 80 patients with neuroblastoma or Wilms’ tumour was included. Pencil beam scanning ({PBS}) (5 mm/ 3\%) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy ({VMAT}) plans (5 mm) were robustly optimized on the internal target volume ({ITV}). Separate 3-dimensional patch-based U-net networks were trained to predict {PBS} and {VMAT} dose distributions. Doses, planning-computed tomography images and relevant optimization masks ({ITV}, vertebra and organs-at-risk) of 60 patients were used for training with a 5-fold cross validation. The networks’ performance was evaluated by computing the relative error between planned and predicted dose-volume histogram ({DVH}) parameters for 20 inference patients. In addition, the organs-at-risk mean dose difference between modalities was calculated using planned and predicted dose distributions (ΔDmean = {DVMAT}-{DPBS}). Two radiation oncologists performed a blind {PBS}/{VMAT} modality selection based on either planned or predicted ΔDmean.
Results
Average {DVH} differences between planned and predicted dose distributions were ≤ {\textbar}6\%{\textbar} for both modalities. The networks classified the organs-at-risk Dmean difference as a gain (ΔDmean {\textgreater} 0) with 98\% precision. An identical modality selection based on planned compared to predicted ΔDmean was made for 18/20 patients.
Conclusion
Deep learning networks for accurate prediction of proton and photon dose distributions for abdominal paediatric tumours were established. These networks allowing fast dose visualisation might aid in identifying the optimal radiotherapy technique when experience and/or resources are unavailable.},

	abstract = {Purpose Various dose calculation algorithms are available for radiation therapy for cancer patients. However, these algorithms are faced with the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally less accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In this work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning ({DL}) for dose calculation. Methods We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation engine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net ({HD} U-net) model and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) cases. Mapping from an {IMRT} fluence map domain to a three-dimensional (3D) dose domain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge training dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to the dose domain using a broad beam ray-tracing ({RT}) algorithm, and then we use the {HD} U-net to map the {RT} dose distribution into an accurate dose distribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/superposition ({CS}) algorithm. The model is trained on 70 patients with fivefold cross validation, and tested on a separate 8 patients. Results It takes about 1 s to compute a 3D dose distribution for a typical 7-field prostate {IMRT} plan, which can be further reduced to achieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. The average Gamma passing rate between {DL} and {CS} dose distributions for the 8 test patients are 98.5\% (±1.6\%) at 1 mm/1\% and 99.9\% (±0.1\%) at 2 mm/2\%. For comparison of various clinical evaluation criteria (dose-volume points) for {IMRT} plans between two dose distributions, the average difference for dose criteria is less than 0.25 Gy while for volume criteria is {\textless}0.16\%, showing that the {DL} dose distributions are clinically identical to the {CS} dose distributions. Conclusions We have shown the feasibility of using {DL} for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high accuracy and efficiency.},

	shorttitle = {Comparison of radiation side-effects of conformal and conventional radiotherapy in prostate cancer},
	abstract = {Background
Radical radiotherapy is commonly used to treat localised prostate cancer. Late chronic side-effects limit the dose that can be given, and may be linked to the volume of normal tissues irradiated. Conformal radiotherapy allows a smaller amount of rectum and bladder to be treated, by shaping the high-dose volume to the prostate. We assessed the ability of this new technology to lessen the risk of radiation-related effects in a randomised controlled trial of conformal versus conventional radiotherapy.
Methods
We recruited men with prostate cancer for treatment with a standard dose of 64 Gy in daily 2 Gy fractions. The men were randomly assigned conformal or conventional radiotherapy treatment. The primary endpoint was the development of late radiation complications ({\textgreater}3 months after treatment) measured with the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group ({RTOG}) score. Indicators of disease (cancer) control were also recorded.
Findings
In the 225 men treated, significantly fewer men developed radiation-induced proctitis and bleeding in the conformal group than in the conventional group (37 vs 56\% ≥{RTOG} grade 1, p=0·004; 5 vs 15\% ≥{RTOG} grade 2, p=0·01). There were no differences between groups in bladder function after treatment (53 vs 59\% ≥grade 1, p=0·34; 20 vs 23\% ≥grade 2, p=0·61). After median follow-up of 3·6 years there was no significant difference between groups in local tumour control (conformal 78\% [95\% {CI} 66–86], conventional 83\% [69–90]).
Interpretation
Conformal techniques significantly lowered the risk of late radiation-induced proctitis after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Widespread introduction of these radiotherapy treatment methods is appropriate. Our results are the basis for dose-escalation studies to improve local tumour control.},

The relationship between the outcomes of and toxicities experienced by patients with prostate cancer treated with {HDR}-{BT}, {SBRT} and particle-beam therapy should provide urologists and oncologists an understanding of the continually evolving technology in prostate radiotherapy. On the basis of published evidence, conventionally fractionated {EBRT} with {IMRT} is considered the standard of care over conventional 3D conformal radiotherapy, whereas {HDR}-{BT} boost is an acceptable treatment option for selected patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer. {SBRT} and proton therapy should not be used for patients (regardless of disease risk group) outside the setting of a clinical trial.

	abstract = {External beam radiotherapy ({EBRT}) constitutes an important management option for prostate cancer ({PCa}). Radiation doses !74 Gy are warranted. Dose escalation of {EBRT} using three-dimensional-conformal radiotherapy ({RT}) or intensity-modulated {RT} improves the therapeutic index by minimizing normal tissue complication probability and increasing tumor control probability. Although higher doses are associated with better biochemical disease-free survival, no impact on local recurrence or overall survival has been demonstrated. Hypofractionation for {PCa} may be an attractive therapeutic option, but toxicity data need to be conﬁrmed in randomized phase {III} trials. Advances in {RT} technology, such as volumetric modulated arc therapy and imageguided {RT}, could facilitate the introduction of dose escalation and hypofractionation into clinical practice. Particle beam irradiation and more speciﬁc carbon ion {RT} are also very promising new techniques that are under investigation. Ultimately, these techniques may lead to focal dose escalation by selective boosting of dominant intraprostatic lesions, which is currently under investigation as a solution to overcome increased toxicity of homogenous dose escalation. This review will give a comprehensive overview of all the recent advances in these new radiation therapy techniques.},

	abstract = {Background Radiotherapy after mastectomy to treat early breast cancer has been known since the 1940s to reduce rates of local relapse. However, the routine use of postoperative radiotherapy began to decline in the 1980s because it failed to improve overall survival. We prospectively tested the efficacy of combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy.
Methods From 1978 through 1986, 318 premenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned, after modified radical mastectomy, to receive chemotherapy plus radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Radiotherapy was given to the chest wall and locoregional lymph nodes between the fourth and fifth cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.
Results After 15 years of follow-up, the women assigned to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy had a 33 percent reduction in the rate of recurrence (relative risk, 0.67; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.90) and a 29 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (relative risk, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.99), as compared with the women treated with chemotherapy alone.

	abstract = {Purpose
Radiotherapy reduces the absolute risk of breast cancer mortality by a few percentage points in suitable women but can cause a second cancer or heart disease decades later. We estimated the absolute long-term risks of modern breast cancer radiotherapy.

Methods
First, a systematic literature review was performed of lung and heart doses in breast cancer regimens published during 2010 to 2015. Second, individual patient data meta-analyses of 40,781 women randomly assigned to breast cancer radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy in 75 trials yielded rate ratios ({RRs}) for second primary cancers and cause-specific mortality and excess {RRs} ({ERRs}) per Gy for incident lung cancer and cardiac mortality. Smoking status was unavailable. Third, the lung or heart {ERRs} per Gy in the trials and the 2010 to 2015 doses were combined and applied to current smoker and nonsmoker lung cancer and cardiac mortality rates in population-based data.

Results
Average doses from 647 regimens published during 2010 to 2015 were 5.7 Gy for whole lung and 4.4 Gy for whole heart. The median year of irradiation was 2010 (interquartile range [{IQR}], 2008 to 2011). Meta-analyses yielded lung cancer incidence ≥ 10 years after radiotherapy {RR} of 2.10 (95\% {CI}, 1.48 to 2.98; P {\textless} .001) on the basis of 134 cancers, indicating 0.11 (95\% {CI}, 0.05 to 0.20) {ERR} per Gy whole-lung dose. For cardiac mortality, {RR} was 1.30 (95\% {CI}, 1.15 to 1.46; P {\textless} .001) on the basis of 1,253 cardiac deaths. Detailed analyses indicated 0.04 (95\% {CI}, 0.02 to 0.06) {ERR} per Gy whole-heart dose. Estimated absolute risks from modern radiotherapy were as follows: lung cancer, approximately 4\% for long-term continuing smokers and 0.3\% for nonsmokers; and cardiac mortality, approximately 1\% for smokers and 0.3\% for nonsmokers.

Conclusion
For long-term smokers, the absolute risks of modern radiotherapy may outweigh the benefits, yet for most nonsmokers (and ex-smokers), the benefits of radiotherapy far outweigh the risks. Hence, smoking can determine the net effect of radiotherapy on mortality, but smoking cessation substantially reduces radiotherapy risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Although there have been dramatic improvements in radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}), including robust intensity modulation and daily image guidance, these advances are not able to account for inherent structural and spatial changes that may occur during treatment. Many sources have reported volume reductions in the primary target, nodal volumes, and parotid glands over treatment, which may result in unintended dosimetric changes affecting the side effect profile and even efficacy of the treatment. Adaptive radiotherapy ({ART}) is an exciting treatment paradigm that has been developed to directly adjust for these changes. Main body: Adaptive radiotherapy may be divided into two categories: anatomy-adapted (A-{ART}) and responseadapted {ART} (R-{ART}). Anatomy-adapted {ART} is the process of re-planning patients based on structural and spatial changes occurring over treatment, with the intent of reducing overdosage of sensitive structures such as the parotids, improving dose homogeneity, and preserving coverage of the target. In contrast, response-adapted {ART} is the process of re-planning patients based on response to treatment, such that the target and/or dose changes as a function of interim imaging during treatment, with the intent of dose escalating persistent disease and/or deescalating surrounding normal tissue. The impact of R-{ART} on local control and toxicity outcomes is actively being investigated in several currently accruing trials. Conclusions: Anatomy-adapted {ART} is a promising modality to improve rates of xerostomia and coverage in individuals who experience significant volumetric changes during radiation, while R-{ART} is currently being studied to assess its utility in either dose escalation of radioresistant disease, or de-intensification of surrounding normal tissue following treatment response. In this paper, we will review the existing literature and recent advances regarding A-{ART} and R-{ART}.},

	abstract = {Background: Stereotactic irradiation of extracranial targets offers a non-invasive treatment modality for patients with localized tumors, which are not amenable for surgery or other invasive approaches because of age or impaired medical condition. The purpose of the study was the evaluation of the method to achieve local control of irradiated targets in relation to treatment toxicity. Patients and Methods: Irradiation was performed as hypofractionated treatment in three fractions of 10 Gy each, normalized to the {PTV} enclosing 65\% isodose with patient fixation in a stereotactic body frame. The isocenter was localized by stereotactic coordinates. Targets were circumscribed tumors in the lung (n = 27) and liver (n = 24) not amenable for other treatment modalities: primary lung cancer (n = 12), local recurrences of lung cancer (n = 4), lung metastases (n = 11), liver metastases (n = 23) and one cholangiocellular carcinoma. Median {CTV}/{PTV} for targets in the lung was 57/113 cm3 (min/max 5–277 cm3/17–343 cm3) and for targets in the liver 50/102 cm3 (min/max 9–516 cm3/42–772 cm3). Median follow-up for targets in the lung was 8 months (2–33) and 9 months (2–28) for liver targets. Local control was defined as complete or partial remission and stable disease, measured by repeated {CT} scans after 6 weeks and in 3 months intervals. Treatment toxicity was evaluated according to the {WHO} score.
Results: Crude local control was 85\% for pulmonary targets and 83\% for hepatic targets. Actuarial local control after 1 and 2 years was 76\% and 76\% for lung tumors and 76\% and 61\% for liver tumors. Actuarial overall patient survival was 48\% after 1 year and 21\% after 2 years for targets in the lung and 71\% and 43\% for targets in the liver. No acute grade 3–5 side effects were observed. Serious late toxicity occurred in two patients: a chronic ulceration of the esophagus at a target close to the mediastinum after 3 months (grade 3) and fatal bleeding from the pulmonary artery after 9 months (grade 5) in a previously irradiated patient. It remained unclear, whether the bleeding was a side effect of irradiation or due to tumor infiltration.
Conclusion: Hypofractionated stereotactic irradiation of targets in the lung and liver is a locally effective treatment with actuarial local control rates of 76\% after 1 year and 61–76\% after 2 years without relevant acute toxicity. Severe late toxicity did not occur, if targets close to the mediastinum were avoided.},

	abstract = {The purpose was to evaluate the clinical results of stereotactic radiotherapy in primary liver tumors and hepatic metastases. Five patients with primary liver cancer and 39 patients with 51 hepatic metastases were treated by stereotactic radiotherapy since 1997. Twenty-eight targets were treated in a ‘‘low-dose’’-group with 3 )/10 Gy (n 0/27) or 4 )/7 Gy (n 0/1) prescribed to the {PTV}-encl. 65\%-isodose. In a ‘‘high-dose’’-group patients were treated with 3 )/12 (/12.5 Gy (n 0/19; same dose prescription) or 1 )/26 Gy/{PTV}-enclosing 80\%-isodose (n 0/9). Median follow-up was 15 months (2 Á48 months) for primary liver cancer and 15 months (2 Á85 months) for hepatic metastases. While all primary liver cancers were controlled, nine local failures (3 Á19 months) of 51 metastases were observed resulting in an actuarial local control rate of 92\% after 12 months and 66\% after 24 months and later. A borderline significant correlation between dose and local control was observed (p 0/0.077): the actuarial local control rate after 12 and 24 months was 86\% and 58\% in the low-dose-group versus 100\% and 82\% in the high-dose-group. In multivariate analysis high versus low-dose was the only significant factor predicting local control (p0/0.0089). Overall survival after 1 and 2 years was 72\% and 32\% for all patients and was impaired due to systemic progression of disease. No severe acute or late toxicity exceeding {RTOG}/{EORTC}-score 2 were observed. Stereotactic irradiation of primary liver cancer and hepatic metastases offers a locally effective treatment without significant complications in patients, who are not amenable for surgery. Patient selection is important, because those with low risk for systemic progression are more likely to benefit from this approach.},

Through direct visualisation of the tumour and the nearby healthy tissues, the radiation oncologist can deliver highly accurate treatment even to mobile targets. Each individual treatment can be customised to changing anatomy, potentially reducing the risk of radiation-related toxicities while simultaneously increasing the dose delivered to the tumour. {MRI}-guided radiotherapy offers a new tool for the radiation oncologist, and creates an opportunity to achieve durable local control of liver tumours that might not otherwise be possible. Future work will allow us to expand the population eligible for curative-intent radiotherapy, optimise and customise radiation doses to specific tumours, and hopefully create opportunities for improving outcomes through machine learning and radiomics-based approaches.

	abstract = {In recent years, the concept of oligometastases has become accepted and reports on stereotactic body radiotherapy as a treatment method have been published. Lesions in the brain, lung, and liver have been reported as target lesions. However, lymph node oligometastases could be a good candidate for stereotactic body radiotherapy as well. In this study, the usability of stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligometastases to lymph nodes is assessed by researching for each primary site. As a result, we could consider that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be almost well applied for lymph node oligometastases from the breast, gynecological organs, and prostate. However, doubts remain concerning the usefulness of stereotactic body radiotherapy for cervical node metastases from head and neck cancer or for mediastinal node metastases from lung or esophageal cancer since late toxicities have occurred with a large radiation dose at hypofractionation to major vessels or the central respiratory tract, especially in patients with irradiation histories. In addition, high-dose irradiation is required to control lymph node metastases from colorectal cancer due to its radioresistance, and severe late adverse events would therefore occur in adjacent organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. In cases of lymph node oligometastases with a primary tumor in the stomach or esophagus, stereotactic body radiotherapy should be used limitedly at present because this patient population is not so large and these metastases are often located close to organs at risk. Because of the varied status of recurrence and varied conditions of patients, it is difficult to determine the optimal dose for tumor control. It might be reasonable to determine the treatment dose individually based on dose constraints of adjacent organs. The oligometastatic state is becoming more frequently identified with more sensitive methods of detecting such oligometastases. In addition, there seems to be another type of oligometastases, so-called induced oligometastases, following successful systemic treatment. To determine the optimal indication of stereotactic body radiotherapy for lymph node oligometastases, further investigation about the mechanisms of oligometastases and further clinical studies including a phase {III} study are needed.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Use of postoperative radiotherapy ({PORT}) in non–small-cell lung cancer remains controversial. Limited data indicate that {PORT} may benefit patients with involved N2 nodes. This study evaluates this hypothesis in a large retrospective cohort treated with chemotherapy and contemporary radiation techniques.
Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients diagnosed 2004–2006 with resected non–small-cell lung cancer and pathologically involved N2 ({pN}2) nodes also treated with chemotherapy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess factors associated with overall survival ({OS}). Inverse probability of treatment weighting ({IPTW}) using the propensity score was used to reduce selection bias. {OS} was compared between patients treated with versus without {PORT} using the adjusted Kaplan–Meier estimator and weighted log-rank test based on {IPTW}.
Results: Two thousand and one hundred and fifteen patients were eligible for analysis. 918 (43.4\%) received {PORT}, 1197 (56.6\%) did not. {PORT} was associated with better {OS} (median survival time 42 months with {PORT} versus 38 months without, p = 0.048). This effect was significant in multivariable and {IPTW} Cox models (hazard ratio: 0.87, 95\% confidence interval: 0.78–0.98, p = 0.026, and hazard ratio: 0.89, 95\% confidence interval: 0.79–1.00, p = 0.046, respectively). No interaction was seen between the effects of {PORT} and number of involved lymph nodes (p = 0.615).
Conclusions: {PORT} was associated with better survival for patients with {pN}2 nodes also treated with chemotherapy. No interaction was seen between benefit of {PORT} and number of involved nodes. These findings reinforce the benefit of {PORT} for N2 disease in modern practice using the largest, most recent cohort of chemotherapytreated {pN}2 patients to date.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Irradiation of the supraclavicular lymph nodes has historically increased the risk of brachial plexopathy. We report long-term symptoms after modern radiotherapy (based on 3D dose planning) in breast cancer patients with or without irradiation of the supraclavicular lymph nodes. Material and methods: We collected information from 814 women consecutively treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer. The women had breast surgery with axillary dissection ({AD}) or sentinel node biopsy ({SNB}). The breast area was treated to 50 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions. Women with {\textgreater}three lymph node metastases had regional radiotherapy ({RRT}) to the supraclavicular lymph nodes. Three to eight years after radiotherapy, they received a questionnaire asking about paraesthesia, oedema, pain, and strength in the upper limb.
Results: Paraesthesia was reported by 38/192 (20\%) after {AD} with {RRT} compared to 68/505 (13\%) after {AD} without {RRT} (relative risk [{RR}] 1.47; 95\% conﬁdence interval [{CI}] 1.02–2.11) and by 9/112 (8\%) after {SNB} without {RRT} ({RR} 2.46; 95\% {CI} 1.24–4.90). Corresponding risks adjusted for oedema ({RR} 1.28; 95\% {CI} 0.93–1.76) and ({RR} 1.75; 95\% {CI} 0.90–3.39). In women 649 years with {AD} and {RRT}, 27\% reported paraesthesia. No signiﬁcant pain or decreased strength was reported after {RRT}.
Conclusion: Radiotherapy to the supraclavicular lymph nodes after axillary dissection increases the occurrence of paraesthesia, mainly among younger women. When adjusted for oedema the contribution from radiotherapy is no longer formally statistically signiﬁcant indicating that there is also an indirect effect mediated by the oedema.},

To review the available data about stereotactic body-radiotherapy ({SBRT}) for oligometastatic lymph node cancer recurrence.

Methods
The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: Medline search for the (1) English language (2) full paper (abstracts were excluded) on (3) adult oligometastatic solid cancer recurrence limited to lymph node that underwent {SBRT} (4) outcome data available and (5) published up to the 30th April 2014.

Results
38 papers fulfilling the inclusion criteria have been found: 7 review articles and 31 patient series (20 and 11 retrospective and prospective studies, respectively) including between 1 and 69 patients (636 lymph nodes). Twelve articles reported only lymph node {SBRT} while in 19 – all types of {SBRT} including lymph node {SBRT} were presented. Two-year local control, 4-year progression free survival and overall survival was of up to 100\%, 30\% and 50\%, respectively. The progression was mainly out-field (10–30\% of patients had a recurrence in another lymph node/nodes). The toxicity was low with mainly mild acute events and single grade 3–4 late events. When compared to {SBRT} for any oligometastatic cancer, {SBRT} for lymph node recurrence carried better prognosis and showed lower toxicity.

Conclusions
{SBRT} is a feasible approach for oligometastatic lymph node recurrence, offering excellent in-field tumor control with low toxicity profile. The potential abscopal effect has been hypothesized as a basis of these findings. Future studies are warranted to identify the patients that benefit most from this treatment. The optimal combination with systemic treatment should also be defined.},

	abstract = {Ready availability has prompted the use of computed tomography ({CT}) data in various applications in radiation therapy. For example, some radiation treatment planning systems now utilize {CT} data in heterogeneous dose calculations algorithms. In radiotherapy imaging applications, {CT} data are projected onto specified planes, thus producing "radiographs," which are compared with simulator radiographs to assist in proper patient positioning and delineation of target volumes. All these applications share the common geometric problem of evaluating the radiological path through the {CT} array. Due to the complexity of the three-dimensional geometry and the enormous amount of {CT} data, the exact evaluation of the radiological path has proven to be a time consuming and difficult problem. This paper identifies the inefficient aspect of the traditional exact evaluation of the radiological path as that of treating the {CT} data as individual voxels. Rather than individual voxels, a new exact algorithm is presented that considers the {CT} data as consisting of the intersection volumes of three orthogonal sets of equally spaced, parallel planes. For a three-dimensional {CT} array of N3 voxels, the new exact algorithm scales with 3N, the number of planes, rather than N3, the number of voxels. Coded in {FORTRAN}-77 on a {VAX} 11/780 with a floating point option, the algorithm requires approximately 5 ms to calculate an average radiological path in a 100(3) voxel array.},

	abstract = {An integrated system of a linear accelerator and a magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) device may provide real-time imaging during radiotherapy treatments. This work investigated changes affecting the dose deposition caused by a magnetic field (B-field) transverse to the beam direction by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Two different phantoms were used: A water phantom (Ph1) and a water-air phantom (Ph2) with a 4-2-4 cm water-air-water cross section. Dose depositions were scored for B-field values of 0 T, 0.35 T, 0.5 T, 1.5 T, 3 T and 5 T. Beams were based on a precalculated photon spectrum taken from an earlier simulated Elekta 6 {MV} {FFF} accelerator. All lateral profiles in Ph1 showed a Lorentz force driven shift w.r.t. the B-field strength, presenting a steeper penumbra in the shift's direction. Depositions were shifted up to 0.3 cm for 5 T, showing a constant central axis plateau-dose or an increase by 2.3 \% for small fields. Depth-dose curves in Ph1 showed a shift of the dose maximum towards the beam entrance direction for increasing B-field of up to 1.1 cm; the maximum dose was increased by 6.9 \%. In Ph2, an asymmetric dose increase by up to 36.9 \% was observed for 1.5 T at the water-air boundary, resulting from the electron return effect ({ERE}). In our scenario, B-field dependent dose shifts and local build-ups were observed, which consequently affect the resulting dose distribution and need to be considered in magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy treatment planning.},

	abstract = {Objective Accurate detection and segmentation of organs at risks ({OARs}) in {CT} image is the key step for efficient planning of radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma ({NPC}) treatment. We develop a fully automated deep-learning-based method (termed organs-at-risk detection and segmentation network ({ODS} net)) on {CT} images and investigate {ODS} net performance in automated detection and segmentation of {OARs}.
Methods The {ODS} net consists of two convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}). The first {CNN} proposes organ bounding boxes along with their scores, and then a second {CNN} utilizes the proposed bounding boxes to predict segmentation masks for each organ. A total of 185 subjects were included in this study for statistical comparison. Sensitivity and specificity were performed to determine the performance of the detection and the Dice coefficient was used to quantitatively measure the overlap between automated segmentation results and manual segmentation. Paired samples t tests and analysis of variance were employed for statistical analysis.
Results {ODS} net provides an accurate detection result with a sensitivity of 0.997 to 1 for most organs and a specificity of 0.983 to 0.999. Furthermore, segmentation results from {ODS} net correlated strongly with manual segmentation with a Dice coefficient of more than 0.85 in most organs. A significantly higher Dice coefficient for all organs together (p = 0.0003 {\textless} 0.01) was obtained in {ODS} net (0.861 ± 0.07) than in fully convolutional neural network ({FCN}) (0.8 ± 0.07). The Dice coefficients of each {OAR} did not differ significantly between different T-staging patients.
Conclusion The {ODS} net yielded accurate automated detection and segmentation of {OARs} in {CT} images and thereby may improve and facilitate radiotherapy planning for {NPC}. Key Points • A fully automated deep-learning method ({ODS} net) is developed to detect and segment {OARs} in clinical {CT} images. • This deep-learning-based framework produces reliable detection and segmentation results and thus can be useful in delineating {OARs} in {NPC} radiotherapy planning. • This deep-learning-based framework delineating a single image requires approximately 30 s, which is suitable for clinical workflows.},

Methods and Materials A residual neural network-based deep learning model is trained to predict a dose distribution based on patient-specific geometry and prescription dose. A total of 270 head-and-neck cancer cases were enrolled in this study, including 195 cases in the training dataset, 25 cases in the validation dataset, and 50 cases in the testing dataset. All patients were treated with {IMRT} with a variety of different prescription patterns. The model input consists of {CT} images and contours delineating the organs at risk ({OARs}) and planning target volumes ({PTVs}). The algorithm output is trained to predict the dose distribution on the {CT} image slices. The obtained prediction model is used to predict dose distributions for new patients. Then, an optimization objective function based on these predicted dose distributions is created for automatic plan generation. Results Our results demonstrate that the deep learning method can predict clinically acceptable dose distributions. There is no statistically significant difference between prediction and real clinical plan for all clinically relevant dose–volume histogram ({DVH}) indices, except brainstem, right and left lens. However, the predicted plans were still clinically acceptable. The results of plan generation show no statistically significant differences between the automatic generated plan and the predicted plan except {PTV}70.4, but the difference is only 0.5\% which is still clinically acceptable. Conclusion This study developed a new automated radiotherapy treatment planning system based on 3D dose prediction and 3D dose distribution-based optimization. It is a promising approach for realizing automated treatment planning in the future.},

	abstract = {Purpose To develop a deep learning method for prediction of three-dimensional (3D) voxel-by-voxel dose distributions of helical tomotherapy ({HT}). Methods Using previously treated {HT} plans as training data, a deep learning model named U-{ResNet}-D was trained to predict a 3D dose distribution. First, the contoured structures and dose volumes were converted from plan database to 3D matrix with a program based on a developed visualization toolkit ({VTK}), then transferred to U-{ResNet}-D for correlating anatomical features and dose distributions at voxel-level. One hundred and ninety nasopharyngeal cancer ({NPC}) patients treated by {HT} with multiple planning target volumes ({PTVs}) in different prescription patterns were studied. The model was typically trained from scratch with weights randomly initialized rather than using transfer-learning method, and used to predict new patient's 3D dose distributions. The predictive accuracy was evaluated with three methods: (a) The dose difference at the position r, δ(r, r) = Dc(r) − Dp(r), was calculated for each voxel. The mean (μδ(r,r)) and standard deviation (σδ(r,r)) of δ(r, r) were calculated to assess the prediction bias and precision; (b) The mean absolute differences of dosimetric indexes ({DIs}) including maximum and mean dose, homogeneity index, conformity index, and dose spillage for {PTVs} and organ at risks ({OARs}) were calculated and statistically analyzed with the paired-samples t test; (c) Dice similarity coefficients ({DSC}) between predicted and clinical isodose volumes were calculated. Results The U-{ResNet}-D model predicted 3D dose distribution accurately. For twenty tested patients, the prediction bias ranged from −2.0\% to 2.3\% and prediction error varied from 1.5\% to 4.5\% (relative to prescription) for 3D dose differences. The mean absolute dose differences for {PTVs} and {OARs} are within 2.0\% and 4.2\%, and nearly all the {DIs} for {PTVs} and {OARs} had no significant differences. The averaged {DSC} ranged from 0.95 to 1 for different isodose volumes. Conclusions The study developed a new deep learning method for 3D voxel-by-voxel dose prediction, and shown to be able to produce accurately dose predictions for nasopharyngeal patients treated by {HT}. The predicted 3D dose map can be useful for improving radiotherapy planning design, ensuring plan quality and consistency, making clinical technique comparison, and guiding automatic treatment planning.},

	abstract = {We present {DeepDose}, a deep learning framework for fast dose calculations in radiation therapy. Given a patient anatomy and linear-accelerator {IMRT} multi-leaf-collimator shape or segment, a novel set of physics-based inputs is calculated that encode the linac machine parameters into the underlying anatomy. These inputs are then used to train a deep convolutional network to derive the dose distribution of individual {MLC} shapes on a given patient anatomy. In this work we demonstrate the proof-of-concept application of {DeepDose} on 101 prostate patients treated in our clinic with fixed-beam {IMRT}. The ground-truth data used for training, validation and testing of the prediction were calculated with a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo dose engine at 1\% statistical uncertainty per segment. A deep convolution network was trained using the data of 80 patients at the clinically used 3 mm3 grid spacing while 10 patients were used for validation. For another 11 independent test patients, the network was able to accurately estimate the segment doses from the clinical plans of each patient passing the clinical {QA} when compared with the Monte Carlo calculations, yielding on average 99.9\%±0.3\% for the forward calculated patient plans at 3\%/3 mm gamma tests. Dose prediction using the trained network was very fast at approximately 0.9 seconds for the input generation and 0.6 seconds for single {GPU} inference per segment and 1 minute per patient in total. The overall performance of this dose calculation framework in terms of both accuracy and inference speed, makes it compelling for online adaptive workflows where fast segment dose calculations are needed.},

	abstract = {Purpose Interests have been rapidly growing in the field of radiotherapy to replace {CT} with magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), due to superior soft tissue contrast offered by {MRI} and the desire to reduce unnecessary radiation dose. {MR}-only radiotherapy also simplifies clinical workflow and avoids uncertainties in aligning {MR} with {CT}. Methods, however, are needed to derive {CT}-equivalent representations, often known as synthetic {CT} ({sCT}), from patient {MR} images for dose calculation and {DRR}-based patient positioning. Synthetic {CT} estimation is also important for {PET} attenuation correction in hybrid {PET}-{MR} systems. We propose in this work a novel deep convolutional neural network ({DCNN}) method for {sCT} generation and evaluate its performance on a set of brain tumor patient images. Methods The proposed method builds upon recent developments of deep learning and convolutional neural networks in the computer vision literature. The proposed {DCNN} model has 27 convolutional layers interleaved with pooling and unpooling layers and 35 million free parameters, which can be trained to learn a direct end-to-end mapping from {MR} images to their corresponding {CTs}. Training such a large model on our limited data is made possible through the principle of transfer learning and by initializing model weights from a pretrained model. Eighteen brain tumor patients with both {CT} and T1-weighted {MR} images are used as experimental data and a sixfold cross-validation study is performed. Each {sCT} generated is compared against the real {CT} image of the same patient on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Comparison is also made with respect to an atlas-based approach that involves deformable atlas registration and patch-based atlas fusion. Results The proposed {DCNN} method produced a mean absolute error ({MAE}) below 85 {HU} for 13 of the 18 test subjects. The overall average {MAE} was 84.8 ± 17.3 {HU} for all subjects, which was found to be significantly better than the average {MAE} of 94.5 ± 17.8 {HU} for the atlas-based method. The {DCNN} method also provided significantly better accuracy when being evaluated using two other metrics: the mean squared error (188.6 ± 33.7 versus 198.3 ± 33.0) and the Pearson correlation coefficient(0.906 ± 0.03 versus 0.896 ± 0.03). Although training a {DCNN} model can be slow, training only need be done once. Applying a trained model to generate a complete {sCT} volume for each new patient {MR} image only took 9 s, which was much faster than the atlas-based approach. Conclusions A {DCNN} model method was developed, and shown to be able to produce highly accurate {sCT} estimations from conventional, single-sequence {MR} images in near real time. Quantitative results also showed that the proposed method competed favorably with an atlas-based method, in terms of both accuracy and computation speed at test time. Further validation on dose computation accuracy and on a larger patient cohort is warranted. Extensions of the method are also possible to further improve accuracy or to handle multi-sequence {MR} images.},

	abstract = {Radiotherapy is a localised treatment. The definition of tumour and target volumes for radiotherapy is vital to its successful execution. This requires the best possible characterisation of the location and extent of tumour. Diagnostic imaging, including help and advice from diagnostic specialists, is therefore essential for radiotherapy planning. There are three main volumes in radiotherapy planning. The first is the position and extent of gross tumour, i.e. what can be seen, palpated or imaged; this is known as the gross tumour volume ({GTV}). Developments in imaging have contributed to the definition of the {GTV}. The second volume contains the {GTV}, plus a margin for sub-clinical disease spread which therefore cannot be fully imaged; this is known as the clinical target volume ({CTV}). It is the most difficult because it cannot be accurately defined for an individual patient, but future developments in imaging, especially towards the molecular level, should allow more specific delineation of the {CTV}. The {CTV} is important because this volume must be adequately treated to achieve cure. The third volume, the planning target volume ({PTV}), allows for uncertainties in planning or treatment delivery. It is a geometric concept designed to ensure that the radiotherapy dose is actually delivered to the {CTV}. Radiotherapy planning must always consider critical normal tissue structures, known as organs at risk ({ORs}). In some specific circumstances, it is necessary to add a margin analogous to the {PTV} margin around an {OR} to ensure that the organ cannot receive a higher-than-safe dose; this gives a planning organ at risk volume. This applies to an organ such as the spinal cord, where damage to a small amount of normal tissue would produce a severe clinical manifestation. The concepts of {GTV}, {CTV} and {PTV} have been enormously helpful in developing modern radiotherapy. Attention to detail in radiotherapy planning is vital, and does affect outcomes: ‘the devil is in the detail’. Radiotherapy planning is also dependent on high quality imaging, and the better the imaging the better will be the outcomes from radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Purpose Targeting and tracking of central lung tumors may be feasible on the Elekta {MRI}-linac ({MRL}) due to the soft-tissue visualization capabilities of {MRI}. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel treatment planning methodology to simulate tracking of central lung tumors with the {MRL} and to quantify the benefits in {OAR} sparing compared with the {ITV} approach. Methods Full 4D-{CT} datasets for five central lung cancer patients were selected to simulate the condition of having 4D-pseudo-{CTs} derived from 4D-{MRI} data available on the {MRL} with real-time tracking capabilities. We used the {MRL} treatment planning system to generate two plans: (a) with a set of {MLC}-defined apertures around the target at each phase of the breathing (“4D-{MRL}” method); (b) with a fixed set of fields encompassing the maximum inhale and exhale of the breathing cycle (“{ITV}” method). For both plans, dose accumulation was performed onto a reference phase. To further study the potential benefits of a 4D-{MRL} method, the results were stratified by tumor motion amplitude, {OAR}-to-tumor proximity, and the relative {OAR} motion ({ROM}). Results With the 4D-{MRL} method, the reduction in mean doses was up to 3.0 Gy and 1.9 Gy for the heart and the lung. Moreover, the lung's V12.5 Gy was spared by a maximum of 300 cc. Maximum doses to serial organs were reduced by up to 6.1 Gy, 1.5 Gy, and 9.0 Gy for the esophagus, spinal cord, and the trachea, respectively. {OAR} dose reduction with our method depended on the tumor motion amplitude and the {ROM}. Some {OARs} with large {ROMs} and in close proximity to the tumor benefited from tracking despite small tumor amplitudes. Conclusions We developed a novel 4D tracking methodology for the {MRL} for central lung tumors and quantified the potential dosimetric benefits compared with our current {ITV} approach.},

	shorttitle = {{TorchIO}},
	abstract = {Background and objective: Processing of medical images such as {MRI} or {CT} presents different challenges compared to {RGB} images typically used in computer vision. These include a lack of labels for large datasets, high computational costs, and the need of metadata to describe the physical properties of voxels. Data augmentation is used to artiﬁcially increase the size of the training datasets. Training with image subvolumes or patches decreases the need for computational power. Spatial metadata needs to be carefully taken into account in order to ensure a correct alignment and orientation of volumes.
Methods: We present {TorchIO}, an open-source Python library to enable eﬃcient loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images for deep learning. {TorchIO} follows the style of {PyTorch} and integrates standard medical image processing libraries to eﬃciently process images during training of neural networks. {TorchIO} transforms can be easily composed, reproduced, traced and extended. Most transforms can be inverted, making the library suitable for test-time augmentation and estimation of aleatoric uncertainty in the context of segmentation. We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation operations as well as simulation of {MRI}-speciﬁc artifacts.
Results: Source code, comprehensive tutorials and extensive documentation for {TorchIO} can be found at http://torchio.rtfd.io/. The package can be installed from the Python Package Index ({PyPI}) running pip install torchio. It includes a command-line interface which allows users to apply transforms to image ﬁles without using Python. Additionally, we provide a graphical user interface within a {TorchIO} extension in 3D Slicer to visualize the effects of transforms.
Conclusion: {TorchIO} was developed to help researchers standardize medical image processing pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments. It encourages good open-science practices, as it supports experiment reproducibility and is version-controlled so that the software can be cited precisely. Due to its modularity, the library is compatible with other frameworks for deep learning with medical images.},

	shorttitle = {Relative dosimetry with an {MR}-linac},
	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to acquire beam data for an {MR}-linac, with and without a 1.5 T magnetic field, by using a variety of commercially available detectors to assess their relative response in the magnetic field. The impact of the magnetic field on the measured dose distribution was also assessed.
Methods: An {MR}-safe 3D scanning water phantom was used to measure output factors, depth dose curves, and off-axis profiles for various depths and for field sizes between 2 9 2 cm2 and 22 9 22 cm2 for an Elekta {MR}-linac beam with the orthogonal 1.5 T magnetic field on or off. An on-board {MV} portal imaging system was used to ensure that the reproducibility of the detector position, both with and without the magnetic field, was within 0.1 mm. The detectors used included ionization chambers with large, medium, and small sensitive volumes; a diamond detector; a shielded diode; and an unshielded diode.
Results: The offset of the effective point of measurement of the ionization chambers was found to be reduced by at least half for each chamber in the direction parallel with the beam. A lateral shift of similar magnitude was also introduced to the chambers’ effective point of measurement toward the average direction of the Lorentz force. A similar lateral shift (but in the opposite direction) was also observed for the diamond and diode detectors. The measured lateral shift in the dose distribution was independent of depth and field size for each detector for fields between 2 9 2 cm2 and 10 9 10 cm2. The shielded diode significantly misrepresented the dose distribution in the lateral direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, making it seem more symmetric. The percentage depth dose was generally found to be lower with the magnetic field than without, but this difference was reduced as field size increased. The depth of maximum dose showed little dependence on field size in the presence of the magnetic field, with values from 1.2 cm to 1.3 cm between the 2 9 2 cm2 and 22 9 22 cm2 fields. Output factors measured in the magnetic field at the center of the beam profile produced a larger spread of values between detectors for fields smaller than 10 9 10 cm2 (with a spread of 2\% at 3 9 3 cm2). The spread of values was more consistent when the output factors were measured at the point of peak intensity of the lateral dose distribution instead (except for the shielded diode which differed by up to 2\% depending on field size).
Conclusions: The magnetic field of the {MR}-linac alters the effective point of measurement of ionization chambers, shifting it both downstream and laterally. Shielded diodes produce incorrect and misleading dose profiles. The output factor measured at the point of peak intensity in the lateral dose distribution is more robust than the conventional output factor (measured at central axis). Diodes are not recommended for output factor measurements in the magnetic field. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.12699]},

This system, using computed tomography ({CT}) data, direction, and characteristics of the beam, calculates the dose at all points of the patient’s volume. The two main factors in treatment planning system are accuracy and speed. According to these factors, various generations of treatment planning systems are developed. This article is a review of the Fast Monte Carlo treatment planning algorithms, which are accurate and fast at the same time. The Monte Carlo techniques are based on the transport of each individual particle (e.g., photon or electron) in the tissue. The transport of the particle is done using the physics of the interaction of the particles with matter. Other techniques transport the particles as a group. For a typical dose calculation in radiation therapy the code has to transport several millions particles, which take a few hours, therefore, the Monte Carlo techniques are accurate, but slow for clinical use. In recent years, with the development of the ‘fast’ Monte Carlo systems, one is able to perform dose calculation in a reasonable time for clinical use. The acceptable time for dose calculation is in the range of one minute. There is currently a growing interest in the fast Monte Carlo treatment planning systems and there are many commercial treatment planning systems that perform dose calculation in radiation therapy based on the Monte Carlo technique.},

            Histopathological classification of gastric and colonic epithelial tumours is one of the routine pathological diagnosis tasks for pathologists. Computational pathology techniques based on Artificial intelligence ({AI}) would be of high benefit in easing the ever increasing workloads on pathologists, especially in regions that have shortages in access to pathological diagnosis services. In this study, we trained convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) on biopsy histopathology whole-slide images ({WSIs}) of stomach and colon. The models were trained to classify {WSI} into adenocarcinoma, adenoma, and non-neoplastic. We evaluated our models on three independent test sets each, achieving area under the curves ({AUCs}) up to 0.97 and 0.99 for gastric adenocarcinoma and adenoma, respectively, and 0.96 and 0.99 for colonic adenocarcinoma and adenoma respectively. The results demonstrate the generalisation ability of our models and the high promising potential of deployment in a practical histopathological diagnostic workflow system.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) are a subtype of artificial neural network that have shown strong performance in computer vision tasks including image classification. To date, there has been limited application of {CNNs} to chest radiographs, the most frequently performed medical imaging study. We hypothesize {CNNs} can learn to classify frontal chest radiographs according to common findings from a sufficiently large data set. Materials and Methods: Our institution's research ethics board approved a single-center retrospective review of 35,038 adult posterior-anterior chest radiographs and final reports performed between 2005 and 2015 (56\% men, average age of 56, patient type: 24\% inpatient, 39\% outpatient, 37\% emergency department) with a waiver for informed consent. The {GoogLeNet} {CNN} was trained using 3 graphics processing units to automatically classify radiographs as normal (n = 11,702) or into 1 or more of cardiomegaly (n = 9240), consolidation (n = 6788), pleural effusion (n = 7786), pulmonary edema (n = 1286), or pneumothorax (n = 1299). The network's performance was evaluated using receiver operating curve analysis on a test set of 2443 radiographs with the criterion standard being board-certified radiologist interpretation.
Results: Using 256 Â 256-pixel images as input, the network achieved an overall sensitivity and specificity of 91\% with an area under the curve of 0.964 for classifying a study as normal (n = 1203). For the abnormal categories, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve, respectively, were 91\%, 91\%, and 0.962 for pleural effusion (n = 782), 82\%, 82\%, and 0.868 for pulmonary edema (n = 356), 74\%, 75\%, and 0.850 for consolidation (n = 214), 81\%, 80\%, and 0.875 for cardiomegaly (n = 482), and 78\%, 78\%, and 0.861 for pneumothorax (n = 167).
Conclusions: Current deep {CNN} architectures can be trained with modest-sized medical data sets to achieve clinically useful performance at detecting and excluding common pathology on chest radiographs.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Monte Carlo ({MC}) algorithms offer accurate modeling of dose calculation by simulating the transport and interactions of many particles through the patient geometry. However, given their random nature, the resulting dose distributions have statistical uncertainty (noise), which prevents making reliable clinical decisions. This issue is partly addressable using a huge number of simulated particles but is computationally expensive as it results in significantly greater computation times. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the computation time and the noise level in {MC} dose maps. In this work, we address the mitigation of noise inherent to {MC} dose distributions using dilated U-Net — an encoder–decoder-styled fully convolutional neural network, which allows fast and fully automated denoising of whole-volume dose maps.
Methods: We use mean squared error ({MSE}) as loss function to train the model, where training is done in 2D and 2.5D settings by considering a number of adjacent slices. Our model is trained on proton therapy {MC} dose distributions of different tumor sites (brain, head and neck, liver, lungs, and prostate) acquired from 35 patients. We provide the network with input {MC} dose distributions simulated using 1 Â 106 particles while keeping 1 Â 109 particles as reference.
Results: After training, our model successfully denoises new {MC} dose maps. On average (averaged over five patients with different tumor sites), our model recovers D95 of 55.99 Gy from the noisy {MC} input of 49.51 Gy, whereas the low noise {MC} (reference) offers 56.03 Gy. We observed a significant reduction in average {RMSE} (thresholded {\textgreater}10\% max ref) for reference vs denoised (1.25 Gy) than reference vs input (16.96 Gy) leading to an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio ({ISNR}) by 18.06 {dB}. Moreover, the inference time of our model for a dose distribution is less than 10 s vs 100 min ({MC} simulation using 1 Â 109 particles).
Conclusions: We propose an end-to-end fully convolutional network that can denoise Monte Carlo dose distributions. The networks provide comparable qualitative and quantitative results as the {MC} dose distribution simulated with 1 Â 109 particles, offering a significant reduction in computation time. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13856]},

	abstract = {A method for photon beam dose calculations is described. The primary photon beam is raytraced through the patient, and the distribution of total radiant energy released into the patient is calculated. Polyenergetic energy deposition kernels are calculated from the spectrum of the beam, using a database of monoenergetic kernels. It is shown that the polyenergetic kernels can be analytically described with high precision by A exp(−ar)+B exp(−br)/r2, where A, a, B, and b depend on the angle with respect to the impinging photons and the accelerating potential, and r is the radial distance. Numerical values of A, a, B, and b are derived and used to convolve energy deposition kernels with the total energy released per unit mass ({TERMA}) to yield dose distributions. The convolution is facilitated by the introduction of the collapsed cone approximation. In this approximation, all energy released into coaxial cones of equal solid angle, from volume elements on the cone axis, is rectilinearly transported, attenuated, and deposited in elements on the axis. Scaling of the kernels is implicitly done during the convolution procedure to fully account for inhomogeneities present in the irradiated volume. The number of computational operations needed to compute the dose with the method is proportional to the number of calculation points. The method is tested for five accelerating potentials; 4, 6, 10, 15, and 24 {MV}, and applied to two geometries; one is a stack of slabs of tissue media, and the other is a mediastinum-like phantom of cork and water. In these geometries, the {EGS}4 Monte Carlo system has been used to generate reference dose distributions with which the dose computed with the collapsed cone convolution method is compared. Generally, the agreement between the methods is excellent. Deviations are observed in situations of lateral charged particle disequilibrium in low density media, however, but the result is superior compared to that of the generalized Batho method.},

	abstract = {Differential pencil beam ({DPB}) is defined as the dose distribution relative to the position of the first collision, per unit collision density, for a monoenergetic pencil beam of photons in an infinite homogeneous medium of unit density. We have generated {DPB} dose distribution tables for a number of photon energies in water using the Monte Carlo method. The three-dimensional (3D) nature of the transport of photons and electrons is automatically incorporated in {DPB} dose distributions. Dose is computed by evaluating 3D integrals of {DPB} dose. The {DPB} dose computation model has been applied to calculate dose distributions for 60Co and accelerator beams. Calculations for the latter are performed using energy spectra generated with the Monte Carlo program. To predict dose distributions near the beam boundaries defined by the collimation system as well as blocks, we utilize the angular distribution of incident photons. Inhomogeneities are taken into account (1) by attenuating the primary photon fluence exponentially utilizing the average total linear attenuation coefficient of intervening tissue, (2) by multiplying photon fluence by the linear attenuation coefficient to yield the number of collisions in the scattering volume, and (3) by scaling the path between the scattering volume element and the computation point by an effective density.},

	abstract = {Monte-Carlo simulation of radiotherapy dose remains an extremely time-consuming task, despite being still the most precise tool for radiation transport calculation. To circumvent this issue, deep learning oﬀers promising avenues. In this paper, we extend {ConvLSTM} to handle 3D data and introduce a 3D recurrent and fully convolutional neural network architecture. Our model’s purpose is to infer a computationally expensive Monte Carlo dose calculation result for {VMAT} plans with a high number of particles from a sequence of simulations with a low number of particles. We benchmark our framework against other learning methods commonly used for denoising and other medical tasks. Our model outperforms the other methods with regards to several evaluation metrics used to assess the clinical viability of the predictions. Code is available at https://git.io/{JcbxD}.},

	abstract = {Accurate and efficient dose calculation is an important prerequisite to ensure the success of radiation therapy. However, all the dose calculation algorithms commonly used in current clinical practice have to compromise between calculation accuracy and efficiency, which may result in unsatisfactory dose accuracy or highly intensive computation time in many clinical situations. The purpose of this work is to develop a novel dose calculation algorithm based on the deep learning method for radiation therapy. In this study we performed a feasibility investigation on implementing a fast and accurate dose calculation based on a deep learning technique. A two-dimensional (2D) fluence map was first converted into a three-dimensional (3D) volume using ray traversal algorithm. 3D U-Net like deep residual network was then established to learn a mapping between this converted 3D volume, {CT} and 3D dose distribution. Therefore an indirect relationship was built between a fluence map and its corresponding 3D dose distribution without using significantly complex neural networks. Two hundred patients, including nasopharyngeal, lung, rectum and breast cancer cases, were collected and applied to train the proposed network. Additional 47 patients were randomly selected to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method through comparing dose distributions, dose volume histograms and clinical indices with the results from a treatment planning system ({TPS}), which was used as the ground truth in this study. The proposed deep learning based dose calculation algorithm achieved good predictive performance. For 47 tested patients, the average per-voxel bias of the deep learning calculated value and standard deviation (normalized to the prescription), relative to the {TPS} calculation, is 0.17\%±2.28\%. The average deep learning calculated values and standard deviations for relevant clinical indices were compared with the {TPS} calculated results and the t-test p-values demonstrated the consistency between them. In this study we developed a new deep learning based dose calculation method. This approach was evaluated by the clinical cases with different sites. Our results demonstrated its feasibility and reliability and indicated its great potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of radiation dose calculation for different treatment modalities.},
