	abstract = {Purpose: The graphical processing unit ͑{GPU}͒ on modern graphics cards offers the possibility of accelerating arithmetically intensive tasks. By splitting the work into a large number of independent jobs, order-of-magnitude speedups are reported. In this article, the possible speedup of {PLATO}’s ray tracing algorithm for dose calculations using a {GPU} is investigated.
Methods: A {GPU} version of the ray tracing algorithm was implemented using {NVIDIA}’s {CUDA}, which extends the standard C language with functionality to program graphics cards. The developed algorithm was compared based on the accuracy and speed to a multithreaded version of the {PLATO} ray tracing algorithm. This comparison was performed for three test geometries, a phantom and two radiotherapy planning {CT} datasets ͑a pelvic and a head-and-neck case͒. For each geometry, four different source positions were evaluated. In addition to this, for the head-and-neck case also a vertex ﬁeld was evaluated.
Results: The {GPU} algorithm was proven to be more accurate than the {PLATO} algorithm by elimination of the look-up table for z indices that introduces discretization errors in the reference algorithm. Speedups for ray tracing were found to be in the range of 2.1–10.1, relative to the multithreaded {PLATO} algorithm running four threads. For dose calculations the speedup measured was in the range of 1.5–6.2. For the speedup of both the ray tracing and the dose calculation, a strong dependency on the tested geometry was found. This dependency is related to the fraction of air within the patient’s bounding box resulting in idle threads.
Conclusions: With the use of a {GPU}, ray tracing for dose calculations can be performed accurately in considerably less time. Ray tracing was accelerated, on average, with a factor of 6 for the evaluated cases. Dose calculation for a single beam can typically be carried out in 0.6– 0.9 s for clinically realistic datasets. These ﬁndings can be used in conventional planning to enable ͑nearly͒ real-time dose calculations. Also the importance for treatment optimization techniques is evident. © 2009 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. ͓{DOI}: 10.1118/1.3190156͔},

	abstract = {{IMRT} optimization requires a fast yet relatively accurate algorithm to calculate the iteration dose with small memory demand. In this paper, we present a dose calculation algorithm that approaches these goals. By decomposing the inﬁnitesimal pencil beam ({IPB}) kernel into the central axis ({CAX}) component and lateral spread function ({LSF}) and taking the beam’s eye view ({BEV}), we established a non-voxel and non-beamlet-based dose calculation formula. Both {LSF} and {CAX} are determined by a commissioning procedure using the collapsed-cone convolution/superposition ({CCCS}) method as the standard dose engine. The proposed dose calculation involves a 2D convolution of a ﬂuence map with {LSF} followed by ray tracing based on the {CAX} lookup table with radiological distance and divergence correction, resulting in complexity of O(N3) both spatially and temporally. This simple algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than the {CCCS} method. Without pre-calculation of beamlets, its implementation is also orders of magnitude smaller than the conventional voxel-based beamlet-superposition ({VBS}) approach. We compared the presented algorithm with the {CCCS} method using simulated and clinical cases. The agreement was generally within 3\% for a homogeneous phantom and 5\% for heterogeneous and clinical cases. Combined with the ‘adaptive full dose correction’, the algorithm is well suitable for calculating the iteration dose during {IMRT} optimization.},

	title = {Long short-term memory networks for proton dose calculation in highly heterogeneous tissues},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06085},
	abstract = {A novel dose calculation approach was designed based on the application of {LSTM} network that processes the 3D patient/phantom geometry as a sequence of 2D computed tomography input slices yielding a corresponding sequence of 2D slices that forms the respective 3D dose distribution. {LSTM} networks can propagate information effectively in one direction, resulting in a model that can properly imitate the mechanisms of proton interaction in matter. The study is centered on predicting dose on a single pencil beam level, avoiding the averaging effects in treatment plans comprised of thousands pencil beams. Moreover, such approach allows straightforward integration into today’s treatment planning systems’ inverse planning optimization process. The ground truth training data was prepared with Monte Carlo simulations for both phantom and patient studies by simulating different pencil beams impinging from random gantry angles through the patient geometry. For model training, 10’000 Monte Carlo simulations were prepared for the phantom study, and 4’000 simulations were prepared for the patient study. The trained {LSTM} model was able to achieve a 99.29 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 1 mm]) accuracy on the set-aside test set for the phantom study, and a 99.33 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 2 mm]) for the set-aside test set for the patient study. These results were achieved for each pencil beam in 6-23 ms. The average Monte Carlo simulation run-time using Topas was 1160 s. The generalization of the model was veriﬁed by testing for 5 previously unseen lung cancer patients. {LSTM} networks are well suited for proton therapy dose calculation tasks. However, further work needs to be performed to generalize the proposed approach to clinical applications, primarily to be implemented for various energies, patient sites, and {CT} resolutions/scanners.},

Accounting for these demands high speed, online intensity-modulated radiotherapy ({IMRT}) reoptimization. In this paper, a fast {IMRT} optimization system is described which combines a {GPU}-based Monte Carlo dose calculation engine for online beamlet generation and a fast inverse dose optimization algorithm. Tightly conformal {IMRT} plans are generated for four phantom cases and two clinical cases (cervix and kidney) in the presence of the magnetic ﬁelds of 0 and 1.5 T. We show that for the presented cases the beamlet generation and optimization routines are fast enough for online {IMRT} planning. Furthermore, there is no inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on plan quality and complexity, and equal optimization constraints at 0 and 1.5 T lead to almost identical dose distributions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Deep Learning ({DL}) is a machine learning technique that uses deep neural networks to create a model. The application areas of deep learning in radiation oncology include image segmentation and detection, image phenotyping, and radiomic signature discovery, clinical outcome prediction, image dose quantiﬁcation, dose-response modeling, radiation adaptation, and image generation. In this review, we explain the methods used in {DL} and perform a literature review using the Medline database to identify studies using deep learning in radiation oncology. The search was conducted in April 2018, and identiﬁed studies published between 1997 and 2018, strongly skewed toward 2015 and later.
Methods: A literature review was performed using {PubMed}/Medline in order to identify important recent publications to be synthesized into a review of the current status of Deep Learning in radiation oncology, directed at a clinically-oriented reader. The search strategy included the search terms “radiotherapy” and “deep learning.” In addition, reference lists of selected articles were hand searched for further potential hits of relevance to this review. The search was conducted in April 2018, and identiﬁed studies published between 1997 and 2018, strongly skewed toward 2015 and later.
Results: Studies using {DL} for image segmentation were identiﬁed in Brain (n = 2), Head and Neck (n = 3), Lung (n = 6), Abdominal (n = 2), and Pelvic (n = 6) cancers. Use of Deep Learning has also been reported for outcome prediction, such as toxicity modeling (n = 3), treatment response and survival (n = 2), or treatment planning (n = 5).
Conclusion: Over the past few years, there has been a signiﬁcant number of studies assessing the performance of {DL} techniques in radiation oncology. They demonstrate how {DL}-based systems can aid clinicians in their daily work, be it by reducing the time required for or the variability in segmentation, or by helping to predict treatment outcomes and toxicities. It still remains to be seen when these techniques will be employed in routine clinical practice.},

This information is acquired by time consuming ray-tracingbased calculations. For treatment planning scenarios with changing geometries and real-time constraints this is a severe bottleneck. We implemented an algorithm for the graphics processing unit ({GPU}) which implements a ray-matrix approach to reduce the number of rays to trace. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of diﬀerent strategies of accessing memory in kernel implementations as well as strategies for rapid data transfers between main memory and memory of the graphics device. Our study included the overlapping of computations and memory transfers to reduce the overall runtime using Hyper-Q. We tested our approach on a prostate case (9 beams, coplanar). The measured execution times for a complete ray-tracing range from 28 msec for the computations on the {GPU} to 99 msec when considering data transfers to and from the graphics device. Our {GPU}-based algorithm performed the ray-tracing in real-time. The strategies eﬃciently reduce the time consumption of memory accesses and data transfer overhead. The achieved runtimes demonstrate the viability of this approach and allow improved real-time performance for dose calculation methods in clinical routine.},

It is capable of Adaptive Radiotherapy and consists of a {GPU} Monte Carlo dose engine, an inverse dose optimization algorithm and a novel adaptive sequencing algorithm. The system is able to compensate for patient anatomy changes and enables radiation delivery immediately from the first calculated segment. {IMRT} plans meeting all clinical constraints were generated for two breast cases, one spinal bone metastasis case, two prostate cases with integrated boost regions and one head and neck case. These plans were generated by the segment weighted version of our algorithm, in a 0 T environment in order to test the feasibility of the new sequencing strategy in current clinical conditions, yielding very small differences between the fluence and sequenced distributions. All plans went through stringent experimental quality assurance on Delta4 and passed all clinical tests currently performed in our institute. A new inter-fraction adaptation scheme built on top of this algorithm is also proposed that enables convergence to the ideal dose distribution without the need of a final segment weight optimization. The first results of this method confirm that convergence is achieved within the first fractions of the treatment. These features combined will lead to a fully adaptive intra-fraction planning system able to take into account patient anatomy updates during treatment.},

The ability of the system to take into account organ motion and adapt the plan to the latest anatomy state is illustrated using artificial baseline shifts created for three different kidney cases. Firstly, for two kidney cases of different target volumes, we show that the system can account for intrafraction motion, delivering the intended dose to the target with minimal dose deposition to the surroundings compared to conventional plans. Secondly, for a third kidney case we show that our algorithm combined with the interfraction scheme can be used to deliver the prescribed dose while adapting to the changing anatomy during multi-fraction treatments without performing a final {SWO}.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop an automated treatment planning strategy for external beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}), including a deep learning-based three-dimensional (3D) dose prediction and a dose distribution-based plan generation algorithm.
Methods and Materials: A residual neural network-based deep learning model is trained to predict a dose distribution based on patient-specific geometry and prescription dose. A total of 270 headand-neck cancer cases were enrolled in this study, including 195 cases in the training dataset, 25 cases in the validation dataset, and 50 cases in the testing dataset. All patients were treated with {IMRT} with a variety of different prescription patterns. The model input consists of {CT} images and contours delineating the organs at risk ({OARs}) and planning target volumes ({PTVs}). The algorithm output is trained to predict the dose distribution on the {CT} image slices. The obtained prediction model is used to predict dose distributions for new patients. Then, an optimization objective function based on these predicted dose distributions is created for automatic plan generation.
Results: Our results demonstrate that the deep learning method can predict clinically acceptable dose distributions. There is no statistically significant difference between prediction and real clinical plan for all clinically relevant dose–volume histogram ({DVH}) indices, except brainstem, right and left lens. However, the predicted plans were still clinically acceptable. The results of plan generation show no statistically significant differences between the automatic generated plan and the predicted plan except {PTV}70.4, but the difference is only 0.5\% which is still clinically acceptable.
Conclusion: This study developed a new automated radiotherapy treatment planning system based on 3D dose prediction and 3D dose distribution-based optimization. It is a promising approach for realizing automated treatment planning in the future. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13271]},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a deep learning method for prediction of three-dimensional (3D) voxel-byvoxel dose distributions of helical tomotherapy ({HT}).
Methods: Using previously treated {HT} plans as training data, a deep learning model named U-{ResNet}-D was trained to predict a 3D dose distribution. First, the contoured structures and dose volumes were converted from plan database to 3D matrix with a program based on a developed visualization toolkit ({VTK}), then transferred to U-{ResNet}-D for correlating anatomical features and dose distributions at voxel-level. One hundred and ninety nasopharyngeal cancer ({NPC}) patients treated by {HT} with multiple planning target volumes ({PTVs}) in different prescription patterns were studied. The model was typically trained from scratch with weights randomly initialized rather than using transferlearning method, and used to predict new patient’s 3D dose distributions. The predictive accuracy was evaluated with three methods: (a) The dose difference at the position r, d(r, r) = Dc(r) À Dp(r), was calculated for each voxel. The mean (ld(r,r)) and standard deviation (rd(r,r)) of d(r, r) were calculated to assess the prediction bias and precision; (b) The mean absolute differences of dosimetric indexes ({DIs}) including maximum and mean dose, homogeneity index, conformity index, and dose spillage for {PTVs} and organ at risks ({OARs}) were calculated and statistically analyzed with the paired-samples t test; (c) Dice similarity coefficients ({DSC}) between predicted and clinical isodose volumes were calculated.
Results: The U-{ResNet}-D model predicted 3D dose distribution accurately. For twenty tested patients, the prediction bias ranged from À2.0\% to 2.3\% and prediction error varied from 1.5\% to 4.5\% (relative to prescription) for 3D dose differences. The mean absolute dose differences for {PTVs} and {OARs} are within 2.0\% and 4.2\%, and nearly all the {DIs} for {PTVs} and {OARs} had no significant differences. The averaged {DSC} ranged from 0.95 to 1 for different isodose volumes.
Conclusions: The study developed a new deep learning method for 3D voxel-by-voxel dose prediction, and shown to be able to produce accurately dose predictions for nasopharyngeal patients treated by {HT}. The predicted 3D dose map can be useful for improving radiotherapy planning design, ensuring plan quality and consistency, making clinical technique comparison, and guiding automatic treatment planning. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/ mp.13490]},

	abstract = {Purpose/objective(s): Online proton range/dose verification based on measurements of proton-induced positron emitters is a promising strategy for quality assurance in proton therapy. Because of the nonlinear correlation between the dose distribution and the activity distribution of positron emitters in addition to the presence of noise, machine learning approaches were proposed to establish their relationship. Materials/methods: Simulations were carried out with a spot-scanning proton system using {GATE}8.0 and Geant4-10.3 toolkit with a computed tomography ({CT})-based patient phantom. The one-dimensional (1D) distributions of positron emitters and radiation dose were obtained. A feedforward neural network classification model comprising two hidden layers, was developed to estimate whether the range is within a preset threshold. A recurrent neural network ({RNN}) regression model comprising three layers and ten neurons in each hidden layer was developed to estimate dose distribution. The performance was quantitatively studied in terms of mean squared error ({MSE}) and mean absolute error ({MAE}) under different signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) values.
Results: The feasibility of proton range and dose verification using the proposed neural network framework was demonstrated. The feedforward {NN} model achieves high classification accuracy close to 100\% for individual classes without bias. The {RNN} model is able to accurately predict the 1D dose distribution for different energies and irradiation positions. When the {SNR} of the input activity profiles is above 4, the framework is able to predict with an {MAE} of {\textasciitilde}0.60 mm and an {MSE} of {\textasciitilde}0.066. Moreover, the model demonstrates a good capability of generalization.
Conclusions: The {RNN} model is found to be effective in identifying the relationship between the distributions of dose and positron emitters. The machine learning-based framework and {RNN} models may be a useful tool to allow for accurate online range and dose verification based on proton-induced positron emitters. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13827]},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop, implement, and validate a full 1.5 T/7 {MV} magnetic resonance ({MR})-Linac accelerator head and cryostat model in {EGSnrc} for high precision dose calculations accounting for magnetic field effects that are independent from the vendor treatment planning system.
Methods: Primary electron beam parameters for the implemented model were adapted to be in accordance with measured dose profiles of the Elekta Unity (Elekta {AB}, Stockholm, Sweden). Parameters to be investigated were the mean electron energy as well as the Gaussian radial intensity and energy distributions. Energy tuning was done comparing depth dose profiles simulated with monoenergetic beams of varying energies to measurements. The optimum radial intensity distribution was found by varying the radial full width at half maximum ({FWHM}) and comparing simulated and measured lateral profiles. The influence of the energy distribution was investigated by comparing simulated lateral and depth dose profiles with varying energy spreads to measured data. Comparison of simulations and measurements was performed by calculating average and maximum local dose deviations. The model was validated recalculating a clinical intensity-modulated radiation therapy plan for the {MR}-Linac and comparing the resulting dose distribution with simulations from the commercial treatment planning system Monaco using the gamma criterion.
Results: Comparison of simulated and measured data showed that the optimum initial electron beam for {MR}-Linac simulations was monoenergetic with an electron energy of (7.4 Æ 0.2) {MeV}. The optimum Gaussian radial intensity distribution has a {FWHM} of (2.2 Æ 0.3) mm. The average relative deviations were smaller than 1\% for all simulated profiles with optimum electron parameters, whereas the largest maximum deviation of 2.07\% was found for the 22 9 22 cm2 cross-plane profile. Profiles were insensitive to energy spread variations. The {IMRT} plan recalculated with the final {MR}-Linac model with optimized initial electron beam parameters showed a gamma pass rate of 99.83 \% using a gamma criterion of 3\%/3 mm.
Conclusions: The {EGSnrc} {MR}-Linac model developed in this study showed good accordance with measurements and was successfully used to recalculate a first full clinical {IMRT} treatment plan. Thus, it shows the general possibility for future secondary dose calculations of full {IMRT} plans with {EGSnrc}, which needs further detailed investigations before clinical use. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Various dose calculation algorithms are available for radiation therapy for cancer patients. However, these algorithms are faced with the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. The fast algorithms are generally less accurate, while the accurate dose engines are often time consuming. In this work, we try to resolve this dilemma by exploring deep learning ({DL}) for dose calculation.
Methods: We developed a new radiotherapy dose calculation engine based on a modified Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net ({HD} U-net) model and tested its feasibility with prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) cases. Mapping from an {IMRT} fluence map domain to a three-dimensional (3D) dose domain requires a deep neural network of complicated architecture and a huge training dataset. To solve this problem, we first project the fluence maps to the dose domain using a broad beam ray-tracing ({RT}) algorithm, and then we use the {HD} U-net to map the {RT} dose distribution into an accurate dose distribution calculated using a collapsed cone convolution/ superposition ({CS}) algorithm. The model is trained on 70 patients with fivefold cross validation, and tested on a separate 8 patients.
Results: It takes about 1 s to compute a 3D dose distribution for a typical 7-field prostate {IMRT} plan, which can be further reduced to achieve real-time dose calculation by optimizing the network. The average Gamma passing rate between {DL} and {CS} dose distributions for the 8 test patients are 98.5\% (Æ1.6\%) at 1 mm/1\% and 99.9\% (Æ0.1\%) at 2 mm/2\%. For comparison of various clinical evaluation criteria (dose-volume points) for {IMRT} plans between two dose distributions, the average difference for dose criteria is less than 0.25 Gy while for volume criteria is {\textless}0.16\%, showing that the {DL} dose distributions are clinically identical to the {CS} dose distributions.
Conclusions: We have shown the feasibility of using {DL} for calculating radiotherapy dose distribution with high accuracy and efficiency. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13953]},

	abstract = {Purpose: Many researchers have developed deep learning models for predicting clinical dose distributions and Pareto optimal dose distributions. Models for predicting Pareto optimal dose distributions have generated optimal plans in real time using anatomical structures and static beam orientations. However, Pareto optimal dose prediction for intensity-modulated radiation therapy ({IMRT}) prostate planning with variable beam numbers and orientations has not yet been investigated. We propose to develop a deep learning model that can predict Pareto optimal dose distributions by using any given set of beam angles, along with patient anatomy, as input to train the deep neural networks. We implement and compare two deep learning networks that predict with two different beam configuration modalities.
Methods: We generated Pareto optimal plans for 70 patients with prostate cancer. We used fluence map optimization to generate 500 {IMRT} plans that sampled the Pareto surface for each patient, for a total of 35 000 plans. We studied and compared two different models, Models I and {II}. Although they both used the same anatomical structures — including the planning target volume ({PTV}), organs at risk ({OARs}), and body — these models were designed with two different methods for representing beam angles. Model I directly uses beam angles as a second input to the network as a binary vector. Model {II} converts the beam angles into beam doses that are conformal to the {PTV}. We divided the 70 patients into 54 training, 6 validation, and 10 testing patients, thus yielding 27 000 training, 3000 validation, and 5000 testing plans. Mean square loss ({MSE}) was taken as the loss function. We used the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.01 to optimize the network’s performance. We evaluated the models’ performance by comparing their predicted dose distributions with the ground truth (Pareto optimal) dose distribution, in terms of dose volume histogram ({DVH}) plots and evaluation metrics such as {PTV} D98, D95, D50, D2, Dmax, Dmean, Paddick Conformation Number, R50, and Homogeneity index.
Results: Our deep learning models predicted voxel-level dose distributions that precisely matched the ground truth dose distributions. The {DVHs} generated also precisely matched the ground truth. Evaluation metrics such as {PTV} statistics, dose conformity, dose spillage (R50), and homogeneity index also confirmed the accuracy of {PTV} curves on the {DVH}. Quantitatively, Model I’s prediction error of 0.043 (confirmation), 0.043 (homogeneity), 0.327 (R50), 2.80\% (D95), 3.90\% (D98), 0.6\% (D50), and 1.10\% (D2) was lower than that of Model {II}, which obtained 0.076 (confirmation), 0.058 (homogeneity), 0.626 (R50), 7.10\% (D95), 6.50\% (D98), 8.40\% (D50), and 6.30\% (D2). Model I also outperformed Model {II} in terms of the mean dose error and the max dose error on the {PTV}, bladder, rectum, left femoral head, and right femoral head.
Conclusions: Treatment planners who use our models will be able to use deep learning to control the trade-offs between the {PTV} and {OAR} weights, as well as the beam number and configurations in real time. Our dose prediction methods provide a stepping stone to building automatic {IMRT} treatment planning. © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine [https://doi.org/10.1002/ mp.14374]},

The study is centered on predicting dose on a single pencil beam level, avoiding the averaging effects in treatment plans comprised of thousands pencil beams. Moreover, such approach allows straightforward integration into today’s treatment planning systems’ inverse planning optimization process. The ground truth training data was prepared with Monte Carlo simulations for both phantom and patient studies by simulating different pencil beams impinging from random gantry angles through the patient geometry. For model training, 10’000 Monte Carlo simulations were prepared for the phantom study, and 4’000 simulations were prepared for the patient study. The trained {LSTM} model was able to achieve a 99.29 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 1 mm]) accuracy on the set-aside test set for the phantom study, and a 99.33 \% gamma-index pass rate ([0.5\%, 2 mm]) for the set-aside test set for the patient study. These results were achieved for each pencil beam in 6-23 ms. The average Monte Carlo simulation run-time using Topas was 1160 s. The generalization of the model was veriﬁed by testing for 5 previously unseen lung cancer patients. {LSTM} networks are well suited for proton therapy dose calculation tasks. However, further work needs to be performed to generalize the proposed approach to clinical applications, primarily to be implemented for various energies, patient sites, and {CT} resolutions/scanners.},

This information is acquired by time consuming ray-tracingbased calculations. For treatment planning scenarios with changing geometries and real-time constraints this is a severe bottleneck. We implemented an algorithm for the graphics processing unit ({GPU}) which implements a ray-matrix approach to reduce the number of rays to trace. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of diﬀerent strategies of accessing memory in kernel implementations as well as strategies for rapid data transfers between main memory and memory of the graphics device. Our study included the overlapping of computations and memory transfers to reduce the overall runtime using Hyper-Q. We tested our approach on a prostate case (9 beams, coplanar). The measured execution times for a complete ray-tracing range from 28 msec for the computations on the {GPU} to 99 msec when considering data transfers to and from the graphics device. Our {GPU}-based algorithm performed the ray-tracing in real-time. The strategies eﬃciently reduce the time consumption of memory accesses and data transfer overhead.

	abstract = {In the framework of the development of the integration of a {MRI}-scanner with a linear accelerator, the inﬂuence of a lateral, magnetic ﬁeld on the dose distribution has to be determined. Dose increase is expected at tissue-air boundaries, due to the electron return effect ({ERE}): electrons entering air will describe a circular path and return into the phantom causing extra dose deposition. Using {IMRT} with many beam directions, this exit dose will not constitute a problem. Dose levels behind air cavities will decrease because of the absence of electrons crossing the cavity. The {ERE} has been demonstrated both by simulation and experiment. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with {GEANT}4, irradiating a water–air–water phantom in a lateral magnetic ﬁeld. Also an air tube in water has been simulated, resulting in slightly twisted regions of dose increase and decrease. Experimental demonstration is achieved by ﬁlm measurement in a perspex–air–perspex phantom in an electromagnet. Although the {ERE} causes dose increase before air cavities, relatively ﬂat dose proﬁles can be obtained for the investigated cases using opposite beam conﬁgurations. More research will be necessary whether this holds for more realistic geometries with the use of {IMRT} and whether the {ERE} can be turned to our advantage when treating small tumour sites at air cavities.},

	abstract = {At the {UMC} Utrecht, in collaboration with Elekta and Philips Research Hamburg, we are developing a radiotherapy accelerator with integrated {MRI} functionality. The radiation dose will be delivered in the presence of a lateral 1.5 T ﬁeld. Although the photon beam is not affected by the magnetic ﬁeld, the actual dose deposition is done by a cascade of secondary electrons and these electrons are affected by the Lorentz force. The magnetic ﬁeld causes a reduced build-up distance: because the trajectory of the electrons between collisions is curved, the entrance depth in tissue decreases. Also, at tissue–air interfaces an increased dose occurs due to the so-called electron return effect ({ERE}): electrons leaving tissue will describe a circular path in air and re-enter the tissue yielding a local dose increase. In this paper the impact of a 1.5 T magnetic ﬁeld on both the build-up distance and the dose increase due to the {ERE} will be investigated as a function of the angle between the surface and the incident beam. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that in the presence of a 1.5 T magnetic ﬁeld, the surface dose, the build-up distance and the exit dose depend more heavily on the surface orientation than in the case without magnetic ﬁeld. This is caused by the asymmetrical pointspread kernel in the presence of 1.5 T and the directional behaviour of the re-entering electrons. Simulations on geometrical phantoms show that {ERE} dose increase at air cavities can be avoided using opposing beams, also when the air–tissue boundary is not perpendicular to the beam. For the more general case in patient anatomies, more problems may arise. Future work will address the possibilities and limitations of opposing beams in combination with {IMRT} in a magnetic ﬁeld.},

            A decade of unprecedented progress in artificial intelligence ({AI}) has demonstrated the potential for many fields—including medicine—to benefit from the insights that {AI} techniques can extract from data. Here we survey recent progress in the development of modern computer vision techniques—powered by deep learning—for medical applications, focusing on medical imaging, medical video, and clinical deployment. We start by briefly summarizing a decade of progress in convolutional neural networks, including the vision tasks they enable, in the context of healthcare. Next, we discuss several example medical imaging applications that stand to benefit—including cardiology, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology–and propose new avenues for continued work. We then expand into general medical video, highlighting ways in which clinical workflows can integrate computer vision to enhance care. Finally, we discuss the challenges and hurdles required for real-world clinical deployment of these technologies.},

	shorttitle = {Adaptive radiotherapy},
	abstract = {Background and purpose: The promise of the {MR}-linac is that one can visualize all anatomical changes during the course of radiotherapy and hence adapt the treatment plan in order to always have the optimal treatment. Yet, there is a trade-off to be made between the time spent for adapting the treatment plan against the dosimetric gain. In this work, the various daily plan adaptation methods will be presented and applied on a variety of tumour sites. The aim is to provide an insight in the behavior of the state-of-the-art 1.5 T {MRI} guided on-line adaptive radiotherapy methods. Materials and methods: To explore the different available plan adaptation workﬂows and methods, we have simulated online plan adaptation for ﬁve cases with varying levels of inter-fraction motion, regions of interest and target sizes: prostate, rectum, esophagus and lymph node oligometastases (single and multiple target). The plans were evaluated based on the clinical dose constraints and the optimization time was measured.
Results: The time needed for plan adaptation ranged between 17 and 485 s. More advanced plan adaptation methods generally resulted in more plans that met the clinical dose criteria. Violations were often caused by insufﬁcient {PTV} coverage or, for the multiple lymph node case, a too high dose to {OAR} in the vicinity of the {PTV}. With full online replanning it was possible to create plans that met all clinical dose constraints for all cases.
Conclusion: Daily full online replanning is the most robust adaptive planning method for Unity. It is feasible for speciﬁc sites in clinically acceptable times. Faster methods are available, but before applying these, the speciﬁc use cases should be explored dosimetrically.},

This new technology for {MR}-guided cancer treatment has the potential to revolutionize the field of adaptive {RT} due to the opportunity to provide high-resolution, real-time {MR} imaging before and during treatment application. However, from a technical point of view, several challenges remain which need to be tackled to ensure safe and robust real-time adaptive {MR}-guided {RT} delivery. In this manuscript, several technical challenges to {MR}-guided {RT} are discussed. Starting with magnetic field strength tradeoffs, the potential and limitations for purely {MR}-based {RT} workflows are discussed. Furthermore, the current status of real-time 3D {MR} imaging and its potential for real-time {RT} are summarized. Finally, the potential of quantitative {MR} imaging for future biological {RT} adaptation is highlighted.},
